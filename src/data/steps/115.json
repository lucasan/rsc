This step toward growth can be doing somethingchallenging, it can be a new awareness, it can be noticing self-sabotage and deciding not to buy into it. But thefoundation for growth, at the heart of whether you move forward in your life and toward your goals, is yourability to be present; to be in the moment.One way of framing the intention to be present, is to decide that whatever you do, you will do it to the best ofyour ability. This can only happen if you are fully present. Only when you are fully aware of the moment, will younotice the self-sabotage; will you notice that your tendency is to repeat old and ineffective behaviors. Only bybeing in the moment do you have choice; that leads to new behaviors and growth!"
