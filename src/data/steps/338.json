    "content": "I am taking you through the 9 pillars of The Path from a place of excellence: the ultimate approach to your\n  life that leads to success, happiness, and health. As a side benefit, it will also result in slowing the\n  aging process.Today I'm focusing on recovering from the stresses of life. These stresses cause the activation of your\n  nervous system which depletes the resources of your body. It throws your body out of balance. Like a car\n  that hasn't been tuned up, with new spark plugs and filters. It is no longer efficient, gets poor gas\n  mileage, only runs on 2-3 cylinders, spews more pollution and most importantly has greater difficulty\n  driving up hills (read: your stresses and life challenges).The result is greater wear and tear on your body and the greater likelihood of an organ system breaking\n  down. It's the ultimate \"Mind-Body Connection\"."
