    "content": "Find your passion and turn it into purpose (Pillars #3, 5, & 9)Recent evidence suggests that purpose in life appears to be important in predicting future health and mortality.  These studies have shown that having a purpose resulted in better cognition at follow up, had a reduced risk of  mild cognitive impairment and a slower rate of cognitive decline. Furthermore, those at the highest levels of  purpose in life were 2.4 times more likely to remain free of Alzheimer Disease than people who reported low  levels. And another study found that greater purpose in life was associated with a reduced risk of mortality  from all causes. These and other studies suggest that the ability to find meaning and direction in life may help  you buffer or slow the effects of aging and even the ultimate outcome: death."
