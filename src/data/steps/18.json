    "content": "Your Primitive Gestalt Pattern, which includes ingrained beliefs and behaviors from childhood, is always subtly influencing you. Messages like, 'this will be hard', 'you can't do it', 'it's wrong', or 'people will judge you' come from this internal voice. This voice, though developed to protect you in childhood, often hinders your growth and success. It's crucial to recognize that this voice, despite its familiarity and seeming helpfulness, is not always right! It often magnifies your mistakes and minimizes your achievements, like a parent fixating on a single 'B' amidst a sea of 'A's on a report card. The key is to focus on your overall success, not the occasional slip."
