    "content": "I'm reminded of the history of breaking the \"4-minute mile.\" For years, so many athletes had tried and\n  failed to run a mile in less than four minutes that people believed it was a physical impossibility. In\n  fact, even scientists weighted in to say it couldn't be done. The world record was 4 minutes and 1.3\n  seconds, set by Gunder Hagg of Sweden in 1945.Then in May of 1954 under less-than-ideal conditions, Roger Bannister, a British medical student ran the\n  mile in 3 minutes and 59.4 seconds. With the mystique broken, 8 other athletes broke the 4-minute mile\n  within the year. Today, over 1,400 athletes have broken this mark!What does this say about the power of belief? What does this say about how your beliefs shape your life,\n  your achievements and your success? Beliefs open doors and break down barriers to achievements."
