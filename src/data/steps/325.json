    "content": "Your common mental/emotional pattern, learned over all the years of your life, can take you in the wrong\n            direction. Every time you say something is difficult, or I don’t know if I can do it, you head down the\n            wrong path; starting off by handicapping yourself. Every time you worry about what someone else with think,\n            or judge you, you are also starting down that crippling path. If you worry that you won’t be able to do it\n            on time, do it well enough – right! – you are also heading down that same path.The healthy, resilient and successful approach of thinking emanates from the healthy internal parent we have\n            been working on developing. Remember, that’s from a place of Love, Compassion, Acceptance, Support and Care.\n            It focuses on the possibilities, not the difficulties; the reasons why you can do it, not what will get in\n            the way."
