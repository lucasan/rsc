    "content": "Let's take our intention to be kind another step, this time with someone in your life who doesn't live with you.  It could be a friend, co-worker or relative. Research has demonstrated that when we focus on something positive  or have a positive attitude, it actually causes a change in your brain: it makes you more sensitive to other  positive experiences. In other words, your brain wants to notice and tune in more to what's positive.  Conversely, when you focus on the negative, your brain again complies by becoming more sensitive to what's  negative in your environment. This demonstrates the tremendous power of your intention to change your brain and  to change your experience. Expressing kindness is one way for you to help your brain focus on the positive."

  "action_step": "Identify someone in your life to whom you will show kindness today. Consider that the quality of the energy that  you project out into your world will come back to you double. It might not come from the same direction you send  it out. It may come from somewhere unexpected. And whether you refer to this as \"Karma\" or the universe being  in partnership with you, it will happen.",
