    "content": "“Life has its rhythm, and your dance with life also has its rhythm\\\" Stephen SideroffI’ve said in other places that our supply of energy is finite. There is plenty there, but it can be easily\n            wasted or sent in non-productive – and even destructive - directions. This occurs, for example, when you\n            hold on to emotions such as anger and resentment or engage in unnecessary worrying. This leaves you less\n            resilient. The most basic of personal goals is to be efficient and effective with your energy – using it\n            purposefully – and then making sure you engage in a recovery process. Remember, everything you do and\n            everything your body does to stay healthy, requires energy. There are different ways of tuning in to your body and how efficient you are being with your energy. You\n            can take your pulse, or heartbeat, for example. The Chinese have 29 different locations for taking the pulse\n            and derive different meanings from each combination. You can use your hand as a sensor, placed on your\n            chest. If you do this consistently you will begin to notice differences in vibrational tone. With practice\n            this can inform you of your “mind-body\\\" state. For example, you might check in and discover excess\n            vibration that indicates an over-activation of your body. When you do this, your body is telling you it\n            needs some calming. If you then address this, you are getting into harmony with your body."

  "action_step": "Bring the fingers of your right hand to your left wrist and feel your pulse. If you slide your fingers down\n            from your thumb to your wrist you will find your pulse. Take a moment to “tune in\\\" to the beat of your\n            heart that is represented by this pulse. There is an important relationship between your nervous system,\n            your cardiovascular system, your respiratory system and even your emotional system.",
