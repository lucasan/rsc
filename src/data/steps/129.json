    "content": "“Life is inherently risky. There is only one big risk you should avoid at all costs, and that is the risk of\n        doing nothing.\\\" – Denis WaitleyWe can create affirmations for each area of our lives: personal growth, relationships and career. Yesterday I\n        focused on your behavior or belief about yourself. Remember, an affirmation you create can always be modified.\n        As you read and meditate on a statement you created, feel into it. Does it completely fit your goal and\n        intention? Give yourself the creative permission to keep modifying these statements until they match exactly\n        what you are needing and wanting."

  "action_step": "For the next affirmation, focus on a goal you are striving for in your career, in your work life. It might be a\n        goal you have some doubts about being able to achieve. It might be something that you have been frustrated with\n        or somehow have been falling short. Remind yourself that by creating an affirmation you are planting the seeds\n        deeper in your mind, in your consciousness. But remember, these messages go deeper, into your subconscious mind.\n        By doing this, they serve to activate you by short-circuiting your resistance and lack of belief.",
