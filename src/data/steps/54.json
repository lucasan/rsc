    "title": "Neuroplasticity versus clinging to your old patterns (Pillars #1 & 8)",
    "content": "We have two very powerful forces working inside us. One serves to help us face challenges and new realities bymaking us optimally adaptive. This is our brain's gift of neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is how our brains learnfrom new experience. Even a one-hour impactful experience triggers new nerve growth in our brains. D.O. Hebboriginally referred to this as \"neurons that fire together, wire together\". But juxtaposed to this helpfulfunction is what I've termed, our \"Primitive Gestalt Patterns\" (PGP). These are lessons, habits and fearsdeveloped during childhood - before we had the ability to choose if we wanted these lessons or not. Many of themlock us into thinking and behaviors that no longer serve us. Yet, because they were developed as part of oursurvival learning as a child, they are very resistant to change. We can say that our ability to adapt has beenfrozen to the environment of our childhood. The current crisis demands that we be open to new learning so we can most appropriately adapt and adjust."
