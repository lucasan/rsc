Today I invite you to identify aspects of your Primitive Gestalt Pattern – lessons from\n        childhood – that get in your way of taking important action. Being successful in getting things done helps you\n        gain greater confidence and trust in yourself. This increase in your sense of capacity results in fewer\n        situations causing you upset. This translates into resilience and success."
