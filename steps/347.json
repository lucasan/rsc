    "content": "“You can be anchored in your past, or by your future vision of yourself\\\" Stephen Sideroff Working hard to\n            heal yourself, to feel good, to get ahead, to be healthy and successful is like climbing up a mountain. Each\n            effort, each hard fought and won “Hand hold or foot hold\\\" that you take and make, is an accomplishment. Too\n            often you work hard, do your best, but feel like progress is so difficult to come by.If you look closely, what happens after your big efforts and struggles to reach a new hold with one hand,\n            your other hand comes along and digs the dirt out from under that hard-fought advance. This is because you\n            are anchored to the lessons of your past; to those limitations – your Primitive Gestalt Pattern, and its\n            spokesperson – your internal voice.One way of addressing this is to focus on your vision, your image of yourself, as you want to be – and are\n            committed to being – sometime in the future. And then, link your behavior, link your thinking to this\n            image/vision."
