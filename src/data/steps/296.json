    "content": "“Culture is the widening of the mind and of the spirit.” —JaWaharlal Nehru The Garifuna International Indigenous Film Festival (GIIFF) takes audiences and moviegoers on a global\n            journey, celebrating culture through film, documentaries, musical performances, art, sculpting, fashion, and\n            dance. The films presented over the years have shown the plight, the fight for survival, and the injustices\n            brought upon indigenous cultures and societies around the world. But the most important aspect of the film\n            festival is how it also brings the culture and the wisdom of indigenous societies to prominence in order for\n            all of us to appreciate and learn important lessons. Many of these lessons have been lost, as we\n            automatically believe that the “new” is better. But wisdom is realizing that no one culture has a monopoly\n            on the truth.\n            Go to www.GarifunaFilmFestival.com to learn more."
