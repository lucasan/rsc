    "content": "I had something else in mind for today's step. Then I went through the day today and encountered a number ofclients, working as hard as they can, but feeling inadequate in the face of so much to do. Instead of appreciatingtheir efforts they were more focused on what they didn't get right, or what they missed. Frequently they had tochoose between less than optimal choices, between two alternatives that both were unpleasant. Afterwards theysecond guessed themselves, feeling they should have done better, even though there was no better option.It is times like these that our negative internal voice/parent comes out and can be loud. It's difficult not tohear it and believe that it's the truth. But it's not! Most of us are way too hard on ourselves - perhaps in amisguided belief that this is what makes us better or work harder. This internal voice is not in your DNA, it'slearned. And it can be, and must be, unlearned. At the same time, it needs to be replaced by a much more positiveand caring internal voice/parent; coming from a place of love, compassion, acceptance, support and care."
