    "content": "“Be patient with yourself. Self-growth is tender; it’s holy ground. There’s no greater investment.” —Stephen\n        Covey Most of the time you give yourself the message that you should be better. That you should be further along your\n        path. But I remind my clients when they say this, that it’s actually impossible. The laws of physics tell us\n        that you can only be in one place at any time. Thus, wherever you are, it’s impossible to be somewhere else,\n        such as further along your journey. When you give yourself the message that you should be further along, you are\n        also saying there is something wrong with yourself for only being where you are. This serves to undermine your\n        self-confidence and success. Wherever you are in your journey, it’s important to be accepting. Accepting the\n        reality of where you are doesn’t mean you are going to stay there. In fact, it allows for your greatest growth."
