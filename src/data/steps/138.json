Were you able to recognize some of the inappropriate thinking of the old pattern? Appreciate your  efforts to identify your old negative thinking and take a step in strengthening a healthy internal voice. This  is putting you right onto The Path.",

    "content": "Have you ever noticed how an animal stalks its prey? Perhaps you have a cat and have observed it preparing to  pounce on a bug or a mouse. They are very focused on their prey. They have a single purpose. Addressing the  inappropriate aspects of your pattern: the behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and beliefs established throughout  your development, requires this focus in freeing yourself from their constraint."

  "action_step": "Whenever you feel some anxiety, feel down, or otherwise get upset, usually the source of this state is a message  from your Old Internal Parent or Voice (OV). It may not be overt, or noticeable, but it's there. Today, stalk  your pattern. Pay attention to the messages you get from your OV. Use any upset as a cue to look for them. When  you do, shift into your Healthy or New Internal Parent or Voice (NV).",
