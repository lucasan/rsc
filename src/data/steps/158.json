This\n        limitation interferes with your resilience and success. In my supervision work for the doctoring program at\n        UCLA, we teach medical students how easy it is for bias to play a role in assessment and treatment. This can\n        happen because of the color of a patient’s skin, their lack of money or a cultural orientation.Resilience is about a willingness to notice your own rigid beliefs and to be flexible and open to new ways of\n        thinking and believing, that take you beyond your existing boundaries."
