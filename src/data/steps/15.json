    "content": "Reflect on how you reacted when you received each daily step. Some days you may have taken the challenge, other days you might have taken it for granted. The key is to: a) dedicate 5-10 minutes each morning to read and decide to take the step, b) remind yourself of the importance of each step in achieving success and happiness, and c) decide that the value gained is worth the time. We often overlook the details as we rush to our destination. Our evolutionary ability to adapt can interfere with our presence in the moment. However, each moment of presence puts you on The Path of Success. To fully engage and appreciate life and function at your best, you need to be present. Only when present, can you break free from old patterns and adopt healthier behaviors."

Keep this level of presence throughout your day. This involves being aware of your surroundings and staying focused. Also, pick an important task and commit to being present while doing it. Before starting, remind yourself to 'wake up, be present, so I can fully respond in a new and creative way.'",
