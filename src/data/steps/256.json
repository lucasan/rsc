    "content": "\"Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, ‘I'm possible!\\\" Audrey HepburnI often hear people say, “That’s difficult\\\", or “I don’t know if I can do it\\\". These statements seem\n            reasonable enough, but the words guide your psychology and behavior. Before you know it, you are headed in a\n            negative direction. The issue is not whether you are right - yes, it’s difficult. The issue is where you\n            place your focus. A focus on what can make a task hard creates resistance in you; a bit of hesitancy. It causes you to brace\n            to the anticipated problem, obstacles, or unknown. It can even contribute to your procrastination. This is\n            the opposite of being in the “flow\\\" which is about trusting yourself and going for it. When you do this,\n            all your energy is going in the same direction. Success will be easier to achieve."
