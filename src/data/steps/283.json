    "content": "Does Hans Christian Andersen know something you don’t? Is this fact hiding in plain sight? Or is this too\n            big a jump for you? Have you developed too much pain and bitterness to make this leap – or to a lesser\n            degree, frustration and disappointment? Remember, your story is initiated by others and is placed upon you.\n            Of course, this sets you in a direction that has consequences. These consequences include any wounding, loss\n            and disappointments.But it’s never too late to take control of your story and thus your life. Buddha said that suffering is\n            “pain + resistance\\\". The story you hold about you and your life impacts your beliefs and your decisions. If\n            you can begin to design your own story about yourself, it will send you in a more positive and successful –\n            and resilient future. (Notice, also, that I repeated yesterday’ quote above as an indication of how\n            important I believe it is.)"
