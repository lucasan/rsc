This year we have all been challenged to make adjustments and adapt to very\n            new and difficult circumstances. This requires your ability to be flexible; to alter plans and goals to\n            account for limitations and dangers."

It also stimulates new brain growth as well as better integration of the\n            two hemispheres of your brain (this integration itself, helps your brain function better). Today, do your\n            self-grooming and eating with your opposite and less used hand.",
