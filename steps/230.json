It refers to strange, stressful, difficult, out of the ordinary,\n            overwhelming, fearful, and unpredictable – all that are being felt right now. You have been learning, on The\n            Path, that ignoring or pushing down reality and your feelings only makes matters worse, since nothing goes\n            away on its own. Dealing with your personal experience of weirdness, is to find the best way forward;\n            realizing that there is always a best way."

Whether it’s anger,\n            frustration, sadness, or loss, accept that this is your reality right now. By experiencing these feelings,\n            you allow them to move through your body so you can then let them go more easily.Next, determine some action you can take to address your concerns. Identify steps that are doable. But\n            remember, you can only do one step or action at a time.While you are doing one step, stay focused on it and realize that this puts you on The Path, so you can let\n            go of what else needs to be done for the moment.Take time today to carve out 15 minutes of psychological space within which to say to yourself, “I’m safe\\\"\n            - so you can let down your guard, and then practice a relaxation exercise for those 15 minutes.",
