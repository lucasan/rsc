    "content": "Your thinking sends you in a direction. It determines the path you head down. As soon as you focus on howdifficult a task or goal is, you create an obstacle - something in your way. As Mr. Ford said, as soon as youthink you can't do something, part of you tries to validate that conclusion. On the other hand, even when youdon't know the solution you say, \"I'm going to find a way to accomplish this\" you send yourself down a differentand more constructive path. You engage your mind in the search for answers and you leave yourself more availableto take action."
