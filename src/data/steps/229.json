    "content": "\"Whoever is happy will make others happy too.\" Anne FrankThe lessons we learn growing up are countless. Even how we ground ourselves emotionally is, to a great\n            extent, learned. For example, we might learn how to be anxious by living with an anxious parent. This is\n            also true of depression. Many who are depressed, simply never learned how to be happy. They didn’t\n            experience enough of it growing up, as they learned to focus more on their depression. If you are focused on\n            whether you are depressed, it will distract you from noticing when you are happy."

If you notice this, try to shift, and come from the healthy voice we are working on\n            developing. How does this support feeling happy?",
