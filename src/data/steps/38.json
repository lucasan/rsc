    "content": "Life is about relationships. You live in relationship to others, and you engage in relationships daily. You are,above everything else, a social being! New research is demonstrating that your interactions with others helpregulate or dysregulate your nervous system and your emotions. All of your interpersonal interactions have thepotential to trigger emotions - emotions that enrich and foster resilience or emotions that are toxic, andeverything in between. How close, how safe, and secure you feel in your relationships plays a role in your health. My second pillar on The Path is about bringing awareness and health to your relationships, so they support youand contribute to your well-being. And when they are not supportive, you can recognize that and take action, sothey don't drain energy and personal resources."

Take a moment to picture that person inthe room with you. Imagine the person in as much detail as possible. Notice how you feel as you picture him orher. Do you find that you're feeling good, feeling calm? Perhaps thinking about this person puts a smile on yourface. You would probably say that being in the presence of this person helps you feel safe and lowers your stresslevel. This relationship can allow your body to take a break and restore needed resources, energizing you andenhancing your resilience.",
