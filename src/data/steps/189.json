It might simply be what will make you\n  happy. Whatever you identify as important, what are you willing to give in order to achieve these\n  objectives? What time and effort are you willing to commit? Making this commitment and following through is\n  what puts you on The Path to success."

  "action_step": "Meditate on what is important to you. Then determine how important, by deciding how much time and effort you\n  will put in to achieving these important aspects of your life. (Such as 15 minutes a day to practice a\n  relaxation exercise.) Then, create an intention around these important goals. Also, create affirmations, or\n  \"as if\" statements written as if you have already achieved them. Keep these affirmations with you and read\n  and meditate on them throughout the day as well as when you awaken, and when you go to sleep.",
