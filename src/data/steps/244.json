What's most important to realize is that you are not born with these qualities - you\n  develop them by following through with difficult actions. At the top of the list is persistence, which is\n  related to your \"will\". It's your effort - and ultimately your ability - to keep going no matter how\n  daunting the situation. It comes from tackling difficult tasks and holding the intention to continue despite\n  the obstacles. The more you take this approach and follow through, the better you will get at it. The results include\n  greater trust in yourself and greater self-confidence."
