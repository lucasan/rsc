    "content": "All the words on this page, in this book, cannot substitute for your experience. You cannot learn about being present, for example, from reading—only from holding the intension to be present. Eugene Gendlin introduced the concept of a “felt sense” as a way to feel into your inner experience. By doing so, you offer yourself an opportunity to uncover parts of you that have been hidden by your defenses and by simply being busy. It is also a way to connect your mind with your body and fully experience being present. Mr. Emerson, in his quote, says, if you want to really learn a lesson and understand it, it must be lived."
