    "content": "At the heart of resilience is keeping a balance between the activating branch of your nervous system –\n        sympathetic – and the recovery branch – parasympathetic. Imagine being in a car in which the engine is revving\n        too high, particularly when it isn’t moving? Intuitively you will realize that this isn’t good for the engine,\n        that it is probably producing unnecessary wear and tear. When we keep our nervous system activated, such as when\n        we worry or when we are hypervigilant, or guarded, we are doing the same thing with our bodies. When you\n        immediately switch from one stressful situation to another without giving your body a chance to recover, this\n        too, creates wear and tear on your body."

  "action_step": "Today pay attention to your pattern. Notice if you immediately go from one stressful situation to the next\n        without giving your body the opportunity for restoring resources used up by the last stress. Notice if you have\n        a tendency to focus on the negative or what can go wrong, thereby also triggering your stress response. Check in\n        with your body throughout the day to notice how your muscles feel. Are you holding tension in your body?",
