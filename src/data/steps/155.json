    "content": "Your thoughts are powerful. Thoughts activate your brain. Thoughts literally change your brain by causing the  growth of connections between neurons. This development in the brain then strengthens those very thoughts that  create the change. This is the basis of learning and even habit formation.Once learning takes place, new thinking tends to follow those pathways and thus keeps strengthening them. It  takes awareness and intention to begin establishing new patterns."
