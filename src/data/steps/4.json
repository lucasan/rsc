    "content": "Believing you deserve goodness is equivalent to self-love. But, some people struggle with this. If you were raised to always prioritize others or to suppress your happiness, you might find it hard to believe you deserve. It isn't selfish or self-centered to want happiness and satisfaction. If you've made mistakes in the past, it doesn't make you unworthy. It's time to forgive, accept yourself, and realize that you are no different from the loved ones in your life. Your Primitive Gestalt Pattern might have shaped your beliefs, but remember there's no good reason for not deserving happiness and satisfaction."
