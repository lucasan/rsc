    "content": "The Gestalt Psychologists in Germany in the 1920s realized that we are all instinctually driven to reach\n      completion, or closure. In the figure below, our minds tend to “fill in the blank\\\" areas and see a star or a\n      second triangle, even though it’s not really there. We are finding a way to complete what’s incomplete. It\n      highlights an important universal truth: we are driven to complete anything that’s incomplete. This can be a\n      project, a conflict or emotions that we experience, but ignore. It can also be fears and worries that might be\n      prevalent during the crisis we are all experiencing.Some of our unfinished business is beyond our control. In fact, in many ways, that’s how life works. And right\n      now, with everyone’s lives put on hold, there may be a growing accumulation of unfinished business. When something\n      in our lives is left unfinished, there is always a part of ourselves that’s distracted, trying to reach\n      completion, such as unexpressed feelings or worries. What’s most important is that you are aware of what needs to\n      be addressed, and find some way of either acting, or expressing your feelings, or consciously deciding to complete\n      what needs to be completed at a later time, if it isn’t possible now. In other words, finding a way to reassure\n      yourself that something will be done, so you can temporarily let go and not continue to be distracted."

Set aside\n      some time to address this by either taking action or by scheduling a time in the future to take action. Once you\n      do this, give yourself the message, “I’ve taken action to get closure on this issue, or I’ve scheduled a time in\n      which to address this piece of unfinished business. I can now let go so I can be more focused on what I’m doing in\n      this moment.\\\"",
