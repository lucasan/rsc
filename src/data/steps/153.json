This includes your\n        spiritual perspective, whatever meaning you hold, your purpose that engages you, giving service and finally your\n        expectations of how the world operates. Do you awaken in the morning with a feeling of dread, of danger,\n        worrying that something bad might happen? Or with positive anticipation of what good might happen? Is it a\n        friendly, or dangerous world?"

Does the current focus on racial injustice awaken your own self-evaluation? Perhaps\n        motivating you to explore how you may have been indoctrinated in a prejudiced narrative? If you have been\n        privileged, due to your place of birth, are you content with that, or do you feel that position might help you\n        better address the injustice toward others? Reflect on how you engage with the larger world.",
