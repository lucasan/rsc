It’ a big subject and at the foundation of your success and resilience. As well as\n      your ability to cope with the current crisis. There are many ways to improve your relationship with yourself. We\n      have already touched on the importance of treating yourself from a place of love, compassion, acceptance, support\n      and care. Even if you didn’t get this growing up, leaving an emotional wound, you can facilitate your own healing\n      by giving these messages to yourself now. But we can go beyond being accepting, by owning and being appreciative\n      of our gifts. This supports your growth."

It doesn’t have to be giant – just\n      something that you appreciate about your abilities, your style, or the way you relate to others. Take a few\n      moments to recognize the different ways this specialness unfolds; how you demonstrate this specialness in\n      different settings.",
