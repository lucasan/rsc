One way to describe sleep is that it’s a time in which we go\n          “inside\\\". This organic and necessary process occurs regularly, every night. It demonstrates the pattern of\n          life, go inside to recover, rejuvenate, and replenish your energy, and then awaken, and thrust out into the\n          world. In the evening, again feeling tired, or drained, you return back inside to sleep and dream and\n          recover.Your energy is finite, though most of us never consider it. Even during the day, it’s helpful to notice the\n          need for a break, a few minutes to relax, go inside and get a mini recovery so you can be at your best."
