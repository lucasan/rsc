    "content": "Optimal functioning and a basic goal of life is staying in balance and returning to balance when you notice\n  you are out of balance. In other words, it's about recognizing your needs and interacting with the\n  environment to get those needs met. This happens when you notice you're hungry and get something to eat. And\n  even when you realize you need a hug. Your needs are physical, emotional, as well as social and\n  spiritual.If your needs weren't met as a child, you may have learned to ignore your needs. This may even make it\n  difficult to recognize the needs you have that haven't been met. When this is true, it's easy to substitute\n  - for example substituting making more money instead of getting emotional needs met."
