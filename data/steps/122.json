  "action_step": "Find your safe and private space – at least for the next 10 minutes. Clear your agenda. Take a moment to reassure\n      yourself that you are safe, at least for the next 10 minutes – so you don’t have to be vigilant and can let go\n      more deeply. Get into a comfortable position and begin focusing on your breath, breathing into the count of 4 and\n      out to the count of 6. On the exhale, allow your body to let go, sink into your chair and relax.Notice what you are feeling. There might be some anxiety or tension. You might notice a resentment lingering from\n      an encounter. As you take a moment to sit and be quiet, other feelings might come to the surface – other pieces of\n      unfinished emotional business (UB).Take a moment to determine how you will address this, later. By putting this UB to the side for the moment, allow\n      yourself to let go of it right now. Notice a sense of peacefulness you can now connect with. You are developing a\n      place and method for centering and grounding yourself. Feel into how good this is or is becoming.",
