    "content": "Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to your awareness of yours and other's emotions, appropriately managing andregulating your emotions and harnessing these emotions for effective interpersonal communication. Today's stepwill address one aspect of your EI: non-verbal communication. You may notice reactions you have to certain people- either positive or negative - without being able to put your finger on anything they said or did to produce thisfeeling. In fact, you were reacting to either the prosody of their speech (stress and intonation patterns) ortheir facial expression. If you are stressed or worried, it will create tension or a flatness in your speech. On the other hand, when youare relaxed your speech takes on greater variation and calmness. Similarly, worry and fear are displayed inunconscious facial expressions."
