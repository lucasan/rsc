    "content": "If I'm not present, where am I? And what does it mean to be present, anyway? And why is it so important? In fact,it's not easy to be present. There are many distractions and fears that pull us from the present. Being present iswhen you are fully in this moment and not thinking or worrying about some future event. It is also not when youare fretting about a mistake you made a few minutes ago. It's not when you are distracted because you areconcerned about a conflict with a friend. Being present is what allows you to be fully engaged in life and besuccessful.In past steps I've referred to the \"contact boundary\". This is where your awareness meets the outside world. Oryour inside world, when you notice some feeling or sensation in your body, such as tension. Presence is when youare right there - at that contact boundary. When we have fearful experiences in our history, failures, or evenjudgements or criticism, it makes us uncomfortable being or approaching the contact boundary. Fear causes us toshrink from the contact boundary, shrink from being present. Based on this, it's easy to realize that the currentcrisis can make it more difficulty to be present, as we tend to move away from what's uncomfortable or negative."

  "action_step": "A very simple exercise - try it - to help bring you present, is to notice: \"what am I seeing now, what am Ihearing, right now, what am I smelling, tasting; what am I touching? When you focus on what's coming in throughyour five senses, you bring yourself right into the present moment. In mindfulness training, the goal is to noticeand be present. Life takes place in the present - not in your heads. Life takes place at the contact boundary.Set reminders on your smart phone today to awaken you to the moment. Set it for 3 times during the day. When itgoes off, stop whatever you are doing and bring yourself into the present moment and notice; be a witness toyourself. Enjoy this experience.",
