    "content": "“When you realize nothing is lacking, the whole world belongs to you.\\\" ― Lao TzuLife happens in this moment, and each moment we are present to witness and experience it. But the nature of our\n        culture trains us to get distracted easily. The result is that we believe we are unable to focus or stay\n        present.In fact, we all have the ability to learn to focus and be present. First you need to want it – intention. Next\n        you need to believe it’s possible – it takes practice. Then you need to engage in a training, to learn to be\n        present. Most importantly, when you do this, you must avoid any judgment or criticism about how you are doing.\n        And finally, you need to be persistent, as old habits die hard."

You can find my free relaxation download\n        to practice (www.DrStephenSideroff.com) or I have found Insight\n        LA to have good audio resources. Here is the link:https://soundcloud.com/insightla_meditation/setsAlso, pick something that is in your environment to use as a reminder to notice yourself. I use doorways. Every\n        time I pass through a doorway it reminds me to notice myself, my environment and be present.",
