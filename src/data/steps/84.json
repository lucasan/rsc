And if\n      you spend much time on the internet or TV, you are continually faced with events that you have little influence\n      over. As I have noted previously, you want to be informed, but you don’t have to hear or see the same information\n      over and over. And you want to make sure you are getting your information from a reliable source. There is more\n      misinformation out there than useful information."

When you notice that you are engaged in this\n      non-productive mental behavior, take a step in developing your power by switching to something you can have an\n      impact on. Switch to thinking and behaviors that will have a positive impact on your life and on your personal\n      development.",
