    "content": "When I ask a group, I'm lecturing \"who has difficulty taking in compliments?\" it's no longer a surprise to seeover half the audience raise their hands. In my work with clients, I find many reasons for this reluctance. Forsome, it's the difficulty overcoming the negative messages from childhood of not being good enough. For others,it's the worry of bragging, or the fear of getting too self-confident. When I refer to taking in compliments, orowning your successes, I'm talking about a natural process of integrating growth steps into your assessment ofyourself. It's this step of identifying your gifts, your hard work, and your achievements that strengthens yourfoundation and supports taking new challenges and new growth. It's not bragging to own these gifts, andachievements. In fact, it's depriving you and the world by not doing so."
