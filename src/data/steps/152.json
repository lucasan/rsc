Lessons of your\n        childhood can manifest in the following ways:1. Feeling responsible for the feelings of others – thus you will be very tuned in to facial expressions, either\n        consciously or unconsciously looking for signs of disapproval or rejection.2. Fear of the anger or rejection of the other person will make it difficult for you to say “No\\\".3. This will make it difficult to set boundaries and thus protect and take care of yourself in\n        relationships.4. Accepting the discomfort of unfinished business between you and another person.5. Which may result in being passive aggressive. If you carry resentment and don’t address it, this will be a\n        likely result.6. Choosing people to be around who don’t have your best interests at heart.7. Choosing people to be around where you feel like you are walking on eggshells.8. Having difficulty taking in the complements of others9. You make assumptions of what someone else is thinking and then react based on this fantasy.10. You have a tendency to make negative interpretations of the behavior of others."
