The crisis keeps us in danger mode,\n      stress mode, triggering our fight or flight response – even when we are not aware of it. This drains our energy\n      and our ability to cope. Your healthy relationships can give you emotional nourishment that helps restore that\n      energy. Remember, healthy relationships are those where you are accepted and loved, not criticized or judged."

By framing it this way you give permission to spend some time together and not feel\n      rushed to end a phone conversation to get to other business. Make it your intention to give and also receive\n      positive emotional energy and care. When this happens, make sure to breath and take it in.",
