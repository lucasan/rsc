Moments in which the new pattern/intention can be\n  spotlighted and chosen to strengthen new brain circuits. Unfortunately, without being present to be aware\n  and to choose the new intention, the tendency is to follow old patterns and thereby reinforce your old brain\n  pathways.At each choice point in your day you will either strengthen a new brain circuit - if you are aware and hold\n  to your intention - or reinforce the old pattern, by following old habits"
