    "title": "Be the change you wish to see in the world (Pillars #3 & 9 – of “The Path\\\")",
    "content": "One theme of my recent “Steps on The Path\\\" is finding ways of feeling in control during a time in which it seems\n      like everything is out of control. In my model of resilience, I emphasize taking responsibility for your behavior,\n      your thinking and your life. An excuse may be comforting and even accurate, but it doesn’t help you grow, gain\n      self-confidence or self-trust. And thus, it doesn’t enhance your resilience. Notice that I indicate this step relating to my pillars #3 and 9. Number 3 is “your relationship to something\n      greater\\\". While this relates to spirituality, purpose and meaning, it also refers to your connection with the\n      larger community. Pillar #9 is “Power\\\" that I define as the ability to get things done. In this step I’m asking\n      you to be aware of the world around you, and what you would like to see different – and then taking responsibility\n      for your own growth along this line to facilitate this process. At the same time, by doing so, it will result in\n      you feeling more powerful, since you will be enhancing your “ability to get things done\\\", my definition of power. When you look around, or see events playing out in the media, what do you complain about? Is it that people are\n      inconsiderate? That there isn’t enough caring? Or perhaps it’s people not paying enough attention and thus making\n      unnecessary mistakes. Many times, the very impairments we have, we project out into the world and see in others."
