    "content": "Emotions interfere with good decision making, as well as taking action. They shift control from your cortex,\n  the top portion and most evolutionarily advanced, to the lower, and more primitive limbic and midbrain\n  regions. When this happens, we are less creative, less flexible in our thinking and more nervous. It is thus\n  helpful to make decisions ahead of time, and before the action is to be taken. Under these more neutral\n  conditions it's easier to make a more objective and less emotional (and perhaps fearful) decision."

Decide today, a. to take action, b. the details of how you will follow through, and c. how you will\n  handle any possible difficulties that might come up. By making a plan ahead of time, by making up your mind\n  as to how you will approach these potential issues, the less fearful you will be and the better the outcome.",
