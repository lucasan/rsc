Thismakes it harder to thrust out into the world or feel comfortable in your body. Yesterday's step was a step towardthe goal of integrity, where how you feel about yourself is in alignment with what you project out into the world."

  "action_step": "What is it that you think or feel about yourself that you wouldn't want someone else to see or know about? What isit that you have some shame about? I'd like you to engage in a dialogue between the part of you - your oldinternal voice - that makes judgments about this thing about yourself; and your healthy internal parent - thatcomes from a place of love, compassion, acceptance, support and care. Make a commitment to yourself to reallylisten to the healthy voice, while noticing the destructive nature of the old voice. By doing this you are takinga step on The Path, and in the direction of greater integrity.",
