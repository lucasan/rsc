    "content": "You don’t realize how difficult it is to be present, until you try. Simply counting your breaths – count\n            them up to four and then start over at one – turns out to be an eye-opener. Try it. How quickly does your\n            mind wander to a thought? Usually after just a few seconds, you’ve lost track of your count. There are many\n            reasons for this difficulty ranging from the media switching images and sound every few seconds to keep you\n            hooked, to your own tendency to avoid and get distracted due to learned fear and an accumulation of\n            unfinished business that your brain is constantly trying to address.Being present makes you more capable to succeed as well as more able to experience positive feelings. To get\n            good at it, requires practice."

At these appointed times, engage in the\n            following 10-minute mindfulness exercise: sit quietly and breath at 6 breaths per minute: four seconds in\n            and six seconds out. Find something to focus on. It can be your breath or an object in your environment. If\n            you lose “presence\\\" or focus during the exercise, simply notice where you shifted to – without judgment –\n            and return to being present.",
