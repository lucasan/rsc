    "content": ".We have much to learn from Native American and in fact, all indigenous, communities. Their wisdom, that we have\n      either ignored or derided for centuries, teaches us that everything is inter-connected. Their wisdom is about\n      experiencing how we are all affected by each other’s behaviors. It is getting more and more difficult to ignore\n      that we threaten the sustainability of our planet – no matter what any leader says. How we treat each other holds\n      the same danger.We are all a part of the community that still displays racial terror! A community that denies equal rights as well\n      as equal justice. To be a part of this larger community means taking responsibility for its health and its\n      healing. Your resilience is connected to the resilience of your community."

  "action_step": "Today, decide that you will take responsibility for the injustice you see all around you. You don’t have to blame\n      yourself in order to take responsibility. In the individual healing process, you must recognize the old and\n      outdated patterns you are still living by. This might include bad eating habits, but also the critical and\n      negative way you talk to yourself. While not putting yourself down for this behavior, you need to take\n      responsibility of recognizing it and doing it differently – from a place of love, compassion, and\n      acceptance.Today, take responsibility for what is happening in your community with racial injustice – try to experience it as\n      happening directly to you. From this perspective, what can you do? What must you do? Take a step on The Path\n      today.",
  "journal_entry": "Write about how you have been noticing or ignoring racial injustice happening all around you. What has been your\n      perspective, and can you look at this with “new eyes\\\"?"
