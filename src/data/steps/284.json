    "content": "Yesterday I asked you to take control over your story. The story you tell, or unconsciously believe about\n  yourself, and live by. This story is very powerful, as it guides your behavior, the direction you take, the\n  things and even people you avoid or are attracted to. As I suggested yesterday, you have a choice about this\n  story. You have a choice about your thinking.When I say, \"a healthy mind\", I'm referring to optimal thinking patterns that support your health,\n  resilience and success. I'm also suggesting that there are thinking patterns that are harmful, undermining\n  and get in your way of these goals.Here are some of the key thinking patterns that indicate a healthy mind:First, looking for what can go right instead of what can go wrongHow it will happen rather than how it won't happenPlanning for all eventualities but then having positive expectationsOnce you do sufficient planning, you don't dwell on, but instead, let go of a problemAvoiding negative language, such as \"this is too difficult\", or \"I don't think I can do it\"Using positive language, such as \"I will keep trying until I succeed\""
