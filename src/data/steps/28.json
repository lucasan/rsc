    "content": "Self-acceptance might be the most important ability and “ground\\\" from which you live your life. When you come\n      from a place of acceptance, it’s like removing friction and resistance from your path. We have a common pattern of\n      comparing ourselves to others and we typically choose someone who does it better or is more successful. But there\n      is always going to be someone you can point to that makes you feel bad in comparison. To accept yourself doesn’t mean you have to love your mistakes. It just means you are accepting the reality of\n      where you are at, this moment. You will get better as you strive to learn and grow. Anytime you put yourself down\n      for not being good enough, you are undermining your success."

  "action_step": "Today identify how you have been critical of yourself. It might be your difficulty staying focused. It might be\n      disappointing a friend by not following through with a commitment. Take a moment to be accepting of yourself. This\n      doesn’t mean you are letting yourself off the hook. Just that you are not putting yourself down. Next, make a\n      commitment to address whatever it is that you fell short on. If you start from a place of acceptance, you will\n      feel much better about yourself which will support your greater success.",
