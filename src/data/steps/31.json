By the way, have you been taking time to practice some form of relaxation?This is an ongoing \"step\".

    "content": "I've used the word \"Gestalt\" previously, which means \"whole\" or complete. I explained two ways that we createunfinished business that needs completion: 1) needs of love, acceptance, attention, validation that are notcompletely met as we are growing up, and 2) feelings that are generated, but must be sublimated in order not to beoverwhelmed by them or feel hopeless. In step 13 I addressed expressing and releasing feelings. Today I want tohelp you with getting your emotional needs met. Unrecognized needs or being in denial of these needs doesn't makethem go away. Instead they go underground. They drive our behavior. But because they are denied, they come out ininappropriate and frustrating ways. They may get translated into making more and more money, greater and biggersuccesses, or conquering members of the opposite sex. The result will be momentary relief, followed byunhappiness, hopelessness or other negative feelings."

  "action_step": "We all have the need for positive validation - for love, acceptance and appreciation for who we are. This may be adifficult step, but one that is so important in our lives. Identify someone you are close to; someone you trustand someone you can take the chance to be vulnerable with. I'd like you to ask this person to tell you somethingthey like about you, something they appreciate about you, some way that they find you special. You can tell themyou are doing this steps program and it is an assignment, or that you are doing an experiment; anything that willmake it easier for you to follow through. Most importantly, when they give you their response, give yourself theawareness and space to fully take in what they say; accept it and let it fill you up.",
