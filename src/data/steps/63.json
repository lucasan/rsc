    "content": "Stress can set us back in our efforts to grow and be more resilient. The Stress of crisis has the tendency to\n      shift control of our brain to the lower centers of survival and emotionality. When this happens, we lose access to\n      newer learning, such as how to be on The Path. Sometimes it’s just too difficult to bring ourselves out of this\n      state. The goal of resilience is to deal with our emotions in a healthy way. This means a) not avoiding them (causing\n      them to go underground) and allowing yourself to feel them so you can let them go, and b) not getting overwhelmed\n      or carried away by them."

Right now, let’s engage in a process in which we allow our emotions to come to the surface, and to fully\n      feel them for the purpose of letting them go or making them more manageable. Let’s call this a controlled\n      breakdown and let go.",
