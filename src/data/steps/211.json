    "content": "\"When you reach the end of your rope, tie a knot in it and hang on.\" -Franklin D. RooseveltI see two important take-aways from what our 32nd president said in this statement. The first is that when\n            you are on your last breath, you find your second breath. The other is a sense of determination. A\n            determination to push through, to reach inside for untapped strength and resilience. I’d like to focus on\n            this latter concept as it implies a methodology for developing strength."

Like the weightlifter who, when he or\n            she can’t do another rep, finds the inner strength to do one or two more. It is in that extra effort that\n            change occurs. Where can you engage in an extra effort? Where have you stopped short? Take some action today\n            where you push yourself, and then appreciate your effort.",
