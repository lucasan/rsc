This\n      makes it harder to thrust out into the world or feel comfortable in your body. Yesterday’s step was a step toward\n      the goal of integrity, where how you feel about yourself is in alignment with what you project out into the world."

I’d like you to engage in a dialogue between the part of you – your old\n      internal voice – that makes judgments about this thing about yourself; and your healthy internal parent – that\n      comes from a place of love, compassion, acceptance, support and care. Make a commitment to yourself to really\n      listen to the healthy voice, while noticing the destructive nature of the old voice. By doing this you are taking\n      a step on The Path, and in the direction of greater integrity.",
