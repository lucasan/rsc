    "content": "It’s the rare person who would say they were parented in a way that met all their childhood needs. Most if not\n      all of you had parents who fell short of meeting the mark. It’s not that they didn’t necessarily try, but their\n      own emotional wounding made it impossible. When this happens, it results in unmet needs that will drive your\n      behavior, but typically, unconsciously. For example, you might only feel good about yourself if you are productive\n      – thus keeping you stressed as you try to live up to unreasonable expectations. These needs include the need for\n      love, acceptance, approval, value, etc. Many of you are good at giving these messages to your children or friends\n      but have great difficulty giving them to yourself."

  "action_step": "While it’s important to be around people who can meet some of these needs, it’s most important to be able to give\n      them to yourself. This is where the development of a healthy internal voice/parent comes into play. Keep in mind,\n      you wouldn’t question what it takes to treat your body in a healthy way: eating healthy food, exercising and\n      getting sufficient sleep. Similarly, you don’t want to question how to treat yourself mentally and emotionally\n      from a healthy perspective. This means hearing your healthy internal parent come from a place of love, acceptance,\n      compassion, support and self-care.",
