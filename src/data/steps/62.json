    "content": "I'm not suggesting that you have hit bottom, but we are all certainly struggling with current circumstances. Oneof the things I've learned is that the more you can be proactive, the more you can avoid the bottoms. In otherwords, you don't want to procrastinate and wait until you hit bottom to learn lessons or how to best cope or beresilient. One way is to become flexible. If you have a goal, an objective, or actions that are not currentlypossible and you simply stay in the place of giving up, being frustrated, or feeling hopeless, you will not turnanything around."

  "action_step": "What or where have you been thwarted in your progress due to the current crisis? How can you look at the situationfrom a different perspective (flexibility) to come up with a different approach (more flexibility)? How can youidentify a more accessible action to take? Give yourself a moment now to identify one of your frustrations. Sitback, take a few relaxing breaths. Let go of your concerns for the next few moments. This will give you greateraccess to your cortex where more effective thinking and problem solving occurs. See if you can re-approach theproblem from a different perspective. Can you think outside the box? Then appreciate whatever effort you made.",
