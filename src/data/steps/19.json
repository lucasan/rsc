    "content": "Getting a good night's sleep is crucial for resilience. It's when your body recovers and replenishes. If stress and tension persist till bedtime, they can disrupt your sleep cycle and affect restorative sleep. An ideal sleep cycle includes stages of light and deep sleep, with the latter essential for full recovery. If you're unable to reach this deep sleep stage, you might find yourself waking up prematurely."

  "action_step": "To enhance your sleep quality, establish a 15-minute pre-sleep self-care ritual. Avoid falling asleep with the TV on. Keep a pad and pen by your bed to jot down any unfinished tasks and when you'll tackle them. Remind yourself that bedtime is for sleep and intimacy, not for problem solving. If you struggle to fall asleep, aim to relax progressively rather than forcing sleep. Whenever you notice yourself thinking, remind yourself: 'No, bedtime is for sleep and restoration, not thinking. I've noted down my pending tasks.' Shift to right-brain thinking by focusing on your breath and the sensations of sinking into your bed.",
