    "content": "In some of my sessions this week I've encountered clients who have been doing ok through the last few months but  are having some difficulties. They have noticed being more irritable, depressed, or anxious. Perhaps it's the  fact that it's now been over four months of this siege, or perhaps it's the latest news that the pandemic is not  at all going away. There isn't a clear light at the end of the tunnel.The stresses, the disappointments, the loss of diversions of our current crisis become cumulative. It is  important to be proactive on a regular basis, to cope with life under the Coronavirus. This means paying close  attention to your feelings; not disregarding them. It means taking time in your day to engage in recovery. It  also means reaching out to those close to you for support, comfort, and connection."

  "action_step": "Today, recommit to being proactive in coping with this ongoing crisis. Recognize your feelings - resentment,  anger, frustration, sense of loss - and give yourself psychological space to feel these feelings and even share  them with those close to you. After experiencing your feelings, find a way to accept what's happening. Not that  you like it, but simply accepting reality. This will minimize the continued frustration that may arise with a  world turned upside down.",
