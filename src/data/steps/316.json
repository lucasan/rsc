    "content": "Being present is like a bank giving your account an interest payment. And the more moments you are present,\n            the more this interest gets compounded. When a bank compounds your interest, that interest begins earning\n            interest on itself. In other words, the interest that’s added to your account starts working for you to earn\n            even more money. Interest on top of interest: interest compounded.Each moment that you are present and – as Mr. von Goethe says – you treat the moment as having “infinite\n            value\\\", the lessons you are available for in that moment immediately begin to work for you to enhance the\n            next and future moments of your life. Like compounded interest in a bank account, this is “compounded and\n            enhanced living, learning and growth\\\"."
