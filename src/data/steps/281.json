    "content": "Shame derives from the unpleasant self-conscious negative evaluation of yourself. Another way of saying this\n  is it results from the comparison of one's actions with the self's standards, which typically are much\n  higher. These standards may stem from a comparison with the perceived ideal self. As you can see, this is a\n  no win, never ending struggle to achieve what's always just beyond reach."

To step onto The\n  Path, speak from your healthy internal parent; coming from a place of love, compassion, acceptance, support\n  and care. Identify an issue or conflict you have been upset with yourself about. Give your healthy internal\n  parent a voice, to support you and be accepting of you. Remember, this is the optimal strategy for\n  resilience and success in your life.",
