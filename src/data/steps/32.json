    "content": "Several of my clients live in the bottom half of life. What do I mean by this? If we were to chart the range oflife experiences, we can divide them by a top half and bottom half. The top half is filled with joy and happiness,while the bottom half is focused on survival and making sure that everything is \"OK\". It reminds me of acommercial currently on TV, where someone is performing at a \"just OK\" level, and the other person has anexpression that says, \"This is not what I'm wanting\". When you are focused on the bottom half, you are worried about what can go wrong, and where is the next dangercoming from. You are trying to keep your life as close to baseline - to OK - as possible; this is success.Achievements are appreciated for their contrast with danger, loss and failure. For some, there is a \"zero sumgame\" in which it's dangerous to get too high in the range of life, for fear of the fall; of the other shoedropping. The Dalai Lama says that the goal of life is happiness. I would say that the only way of achieving happiness isto set it as your goal."

Even if this is foreign to you, overcome any resistanceyou might have and plan on finding something that puts a smile on your face, or otherwise makes you want to \"jumpfor joy\".

Give the inside of your body a good healing massage.",
