I had an immediate and automatic adjustment to\n  shift my weight and avoid stress on my ankle that could have resulted in injury. It was an example of how\n  physical flexibility contributed to my resilience.When you keep trying to solve a problem in the same way, with the same thinking pattern or framework, you\n  will keep getting the same result. This is where it's important to be able to \"think outside the box\". And\n  it's also a problem when you get stuck in an emotional holding pattern."
