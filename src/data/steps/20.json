    "content": "Our relationship with emotions can be complicated due to past experiences and discomfort. Feelings like anger, sadness, or crying are often suppressed due to perceived weakness. Sometimes, we dismiss these feelings before we fully acknowledge them. This leads to Unfinished Emotional Business (UEB), which can be traced back to childhood. UEB manifests when minor incidents trigger major reactions, causing relationship strains, depression, anxiety, or draining resentment. The reasons we avoid addressing UEB are: 1) we judge the feelings negatively, and 2) we fear expressing our feelings might lead to rejection. It's crucial to understand that feelings, like hunger, need attention and resolution. Interestingly, to resolve these feelings, you don't need anyone else."

  "action_step": "Begin by eliminating the 'right or wrong' judgement from feelings, similar to how we won't label hunger as wrong. Your feelings are natural responses that need acknowledgment. Secondly, understand that you can let go of a feeling without anyone's help. You might want others to validate your feelings, but that's not always in your control. Consider an emotion you've been holding onto, like resentment or anger, and follow a four-step process to reach resolution.",
