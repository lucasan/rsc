    "content": "When working with elite and professional athletes – as well as up-and-coming athletes – I always help them\n        visualize their goals and their best performance. This has many advantages. First, it’s important to know what\n        you want and what it looks like to help you go in the right direction. Setting goals and having an intention is\n        like creating guidelines to stay within your path.In addition, being able to dream and visualize those dreams helps create representations of them in your brain.\n        The more you engage in this dreaming process – with purpose – the more your brain tells you they are “do-able\\\";\n        because now they sit within you. We can think of this another way, each time you dream with purpose, you are\n        engaging in a dress rehearsal for new behaviors and new thinking. Like any rehearsal, you get better and better\n        at it."

  "action_step": "Take 10-15 minutes today to dream; to visualize/picture your optimal future. Try not to judge or allow your\n        negative voice to tell you It's not possible. Give yourself the “psychological space\\\" to dream without\n        interfering in the process. Notice how you feel doing this. Make this an ongoing process, with each time you\n        engage in it, taking it a bit further or flushing out more details.",
