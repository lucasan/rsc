    "content": "Quantum physics has been with us for over 100 years, yet in many respects it’s still a mystery. It’s still a\n            concept that is difficult to grasp. One of the main core research findings is that on the microscopic level,\n            the physical Universe only comes into being upon observation. Until there is the observation, there are only\n            possibilities. What does this say for how to live your life?It tells me that if I don’t think something is possible – or I focus on how it is not possible – I won’t\n            bring it into reality. On the other hand, if I do focus on the possibility of what I want - to happen – my\n            focus then facilitates bringing it into reality."
