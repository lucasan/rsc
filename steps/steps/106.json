You place restrictions on the universe with your expectations.\\\" – Deepak\n      ChopraStep of the day: Using expectation to help you be resilient and successful (Pillar #5)When you look into the future, where do your thoughts go? Do you think about what can go right? Or what can go\n      wrong? Do you focus on the obstacles, or how difficult the task will be? For some of you this takes the form of\n      “catastrophic thinking\\\"; imagining the worst that can happen. Your thinking pattern sends you in a direction.\n      When it does, it can support you or get in your way. It can help you be resilient, or it can create more stress\n      for yourself.Remember, simply thinking of a danger, of what can go wrong, will activate your body’s stress response. Your body\n      prepares you for the danger even if it never occurs. During this period of crisis, it’s easier to go into the\n      negative. But it still doesn’t serve you. On the other hand, when you focus on what can go right, and focus on the\n      goal instead of the obstacles, you will have greater success."
