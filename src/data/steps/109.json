    "content": "Identifying the personal energy you project into your environment and your encounters (Pillar#7)Sometimes presence is easier to notice than to define. There are people with whom you feel comfortable and otherswho can make you feel uncomfortable. Why is this? It turns out that you project important aspects of yourself inyour facial expressions and in the way that you talk. These unconscious messages have evolved to let others knowabout the safety of you as well as the present situation. But you may be projecting messages you are not aware ofor prefer not to be sending. For example, if you are worried or stressed it can create tension in both your voiceand your face. This tension can give a signal of danger or uncertainty that unconsciously puts some apprehensionor disease into your encounters. Similarly, a parent who is preoccupied with some upset in their own life, canproject this in talking to their child. The result is that the child feels this discord and may believe they didsomething wrong."
