    "content": "It's my hope that you take a few minutes each day to follow these steps that will help you better cope with thecurrent crisis and be resilient. Since I write all these steps, I am thus more in touch with the messages. Yet,even I can notice at times that I'm feeling the effects of this crisis. I can feel the tension in my body, or thepounding of my heart - a vibration in my chest that I know not to ignore. If this is happening to me, I'm sureit's also happening to you. No one is immune! I have trained myself to notice signs of my stress response before it begins to take a toll on my body and mind.When I notice the physical sensations, I give myself the opportunity to reassure myself and quiet my body.Sometimes it doesn't happen immediately, but I don't give up. I have patience and continue with the techniquesI've learned and have been sharing with you. I encourage all of you to do the same. Remember, if you ignore thisinternal process because you feel that the problem is out there and you can't do anything about it, you leaveyourself vulnerable to the harmful effects of this stress."
