But most of the time we blow right past choice points as we follow our old pattern. A choice\n            point might be when you shy away from a challenge because it’s uncomfortable, perceived as being too\n            difficult or perhaps you imagine it won’t turn out the way you want. If you awaken to this moment, you might\n            instead decide, “let me make a different choice, by adopting a new perspective, in which I imagine that it\n            will turn out well, or that I can be more accepting of my actions.Choice points are those moments in which you can decide to think, feel and frame a situation in a more\n            positive, constructive and supportive manner. This new decision will change your life."
