    "content": "“What you resist persists\\\" AnonymousAt the simplest of levels when you procrastinate you get in the way of your progress. But procrastination is\n            also about not keeping your word! You say you are going to do something – or say you want to do something –\n            and then don’t follow through. This sends an unconscious message to yourself. That message is, “I don’t keep\n            my word\\\", “I can’t count on myself\\\", “I don’t follow through\\\" “I give up too easily\\\" or “I experience\n            actions I need to take as being too difficult for me\\\". This undermines trust in yourself and ultimately\n            impacts self-confidence.To be most effective in life, it’s important to keep your word – especially to yourself! If there is\n            something that needs to be done, you “Just do it\\\" as the Nike saying goes."
