    "content": "“Stress is not necessarily bad, as long as you make sure to recover from it\\\" Stephen SideroffThere are stresses that can be considered “good\\\" stresses, such as getting a promotion or having a baby.\n            Hans Selye, referred to these as “eustress\\\". There are also stresses, referred to as distress, that can be\n            particularly harmful physically. Stresses that you don’t feel in control over, stresses that are dangerous\n            and stresses that are chronic are negative stresses. All stresses activate your nervous system.It’s possible to cope well with all stresses. The important way of optimal coping is to a. remember to\n            disengage from the stress after it’s over, and b. to engage in a recovery process.When a stress is over it’s important to consciously tell yourself, you are now safe and can relax.Recovery is facilitated by taking a few minutes to practice a relaxation exercise."
