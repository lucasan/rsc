Adapting involves engaging with your environment, your world, and then getting\n  feedback letting you know if your action was effective or not. Adaptation is about using that feedback to\n  make adjustments and try again. And then repeat and repeat; with the intention of getting better and better\n  with each effort. Thomas Edison tried over 1,000 times before he got the light bulb right.Part of this process is not labeling actions that don't turn out the way you want, as failures, but positive\n  efforts needing adjustment."
