This means unconsciously following\n        old patterns, typically learned during childhood. It’s not necessarily that these patterns are bad or negative –\n        although they frequently are – but they are certainly not something that you chose. When you are feeling upset\n        or discouraged, you can find an inappropriate message unconsciously given to you from that old pattern, that\n        triggers the upset.You will notice that I reference pillar # 7 as being strengthened or further developed with this daily step.\n        Pillar 7 is “Presence\\\". In order to begin making decisions for yourself, you must first awaken to the moment –\n        become present – to notice that you are being controlled by the old messages. Then you are able to make a\n        choice: continue down this negative path or decide to focus on something more positive."
