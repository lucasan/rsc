As soon as you focus on how\n      difficult a task or goal is, you create an obstacle – something in your way. As Mr. Ford said, as soon as you\n      think you can’t do something, part of you tries to validate that conclusion. On the other hand, even when you\n      don’t know the solution you say, “I’m going to find a way to accomplish this\\\" you send yourself down a different\n      and more constructive path. You engage your mind in the search for answers and you leave yourself more available\n      to take action."

At the same time, notice any tendency to\n      focus on how something is a problem instead of a challenge; difficult instead of simply deciding it’s something\n      needing to be done. Notice your old internal parent – part of your Primitive Gestalt Pattern we have been\n      discussing – stepping in to discourage or question your ability. When this happens, make the conscious choice to\n      switch to the healthy internal parent coming from a place of love, acceptance, compassion, support and care.
