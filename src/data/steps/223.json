And the beauty about this is it\n  gives you an experience of engagement and lessons to be learned - with very little risk. In life, it's easy\n  to get stuck focusing on the danger, what can go wrong, what mistake you might make or fear of\n  rejection.But life can be thought of as a much larger \"field of play\". And while there are greater risks than on a\n  ball field, most of what we fear is due to our old internal parent, that comes from a negative or judgmental\n  place."
