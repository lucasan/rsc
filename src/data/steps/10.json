    "title": "Building a Healthy Internal Parent/Voice (Pillar 1)",
    "content": "Your internal voice, a representative of your Primitive Gestalt Pattern, influences your decisions all day, every day. Often, this voice echoes childhood lessons from parents and society. To benefit from it, you must become aware of its impact, especially when it triggers negative emotions like anxiety or worry. A healthy internal voice-one we're cultivating on The Path-originates from love, compassion, acceptance, support, and care. Listen to your voice and assess if it aligns with this perspective. Regardless of your past mistakes, you deserve to communicate with yourself through this empowering internal voice."
