It's great to have someone who is on your side, wants the best for you and has the skills to help you make  the right choices.But you don't need to go out and find someone to have a great coach right at your side - whenever you want one.  I suggest that you can be a great coach for yourself. In many respects, no one knows you better than you, and no  one can want your success more than you."
