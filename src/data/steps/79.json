    "content": "I have found that one of the most difficult steps in life - in moving forward - is letting go. We have so manyattachments; to people, to habits and behaviors, to things. We also have attachments to aspects of our history,our decisions, our wounds. Yes, we can be attached to our wounds, as strange as that sounds.When we have unfinished emotional business, where we are still upset with a friend or relative, or co-worker, andwe are trying to move on - attachment can get in our way. For example, our friend didn't respond the way we wouldhave liked or expected him or her to respond. Perhaps, they didn't call you back, or think about you on yourbirthday. Being attached to how they should have responded, will get in the way of letting go of the upset thatgets in the way of the relationship."
