Normally it’s easy to distract yourself when you come up\n      against an obstacle. It might be something external, but it’s frequently within your own process. I’m referring to\n      a lack of trust in your ability to take a step, or your worry that others will judge, or that you will not be\n      successful. When this happens, there are so many other things that can conveniently pull you in different\n      directions. You have so many opportunities for distraction.Let’s use the quote from President Roosevelt today to guide your behavior and stick with something that is\n      difficult."

Take\n      this quote to heart – do what you can, with what you have, where you are - as an approach to move past your\n      obstacle. Use it to sit with what’s difficult. Allow yourself to be uncomfortable. And remember your healthy\n      internal parent, who will say to you, “You are OK, I accept you, and I believe in you.\\\"",
