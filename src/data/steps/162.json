    "content": "My ninth pillar of resilience and success is \"power\" that I define as the ability to get things done. In the  attached diagram, you will note that this pillar is supported by my other eight pillars. In the last few days,  I've been giving you \"steps\" that help you take a difficult action; a step that is perhaps new and can take you  to the next level in your career or life. It is these steps that move you outside of your comfort zone, your  current boundaries and is the source of greater self-confidence.Thus far we have identified aspects of your Primitive Gestalt Pattern that get in your way, as well as your  abilities and gifts that have yielded previous success, connecting with your passion and doing a \"dress  rehearsal\" and affirmations."
