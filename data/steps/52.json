    "content": "Research has demonstrated that whatever is associated with intense emotions is learned best. This is why fears\n      become so imprinted in us. This has an adaptive aspect (if there is real danger, you want to learn this lesson\n      well, such as when you touch a hot stove.) But be careful today that your fears don’t result in many harmful\n      lessons imprinted in your brain and body."

  "action_step": "to enhance best learningPay attention to your emotions rather than ignoring them today. Accept them without judgment. Feel them, express\n      them. And then let them go. A helpful way to do this is by giving yourself the following message: “I know this\n      situation is not over, but I’ve given myself some time to experience these feelings and have allowed them to move\n      through my body. I’ve also taken whatever steps I can right now to cope. Therefore, the best thing to do is let go\n      and shift my focus to something more positive.\\\"",
