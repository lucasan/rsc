    "content": "Being present, being aware in the moment, is both important and elusive. What’s more, you might not even know\n        how difficult it is for you. Learning and adaptation are strange bedfellows. We are great at learning. But we\n        are also designed to adapt quickly. So, we learn fast and then turn the learning into a habit. The important\n        things about habits are, a. they help you do routine behaviors fast and with little attention to them, so you\n        can focus on something else, and b. They render you a bit unconscious and prone to not being present. When you\n        add to this the wide array of distractions surrounding you, it makes it difficult to stay in the present, even\n        when you are determined to be.We have the greatest chance of giving our best performance if we are fully present in the moment. It is the only\n        place where choice and peak performance occur."

  "action_step": "As an exercise, take 15 minutes to sit quietly and go into your 6 breaths per minute exercise. At the same time,\n        count your breaths, up to “4\\\" and then start over again with “1\\\". Notice how long you can maintain this before\n        your mind goes just a bit astray. Keep trying and noticing your pattern. This exercise actually trains better\n        presence. In later steps we will address the other aspects of presence.",
