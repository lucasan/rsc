    "content": "It is easy to fall back into bad habits, old habits. One of the purposes of creating and reviewing\n  affirmations daily is to remember your intentions and remember The Path. If your affirmations found their\n  way into a drawer, pull them out so you can read them throughout the day. If you haven't yet created any,\n  now's a good time to do so. Affirmations are statements about your goals, written as if they have already\n  been achieved.Approaching life with a positive attitude is an effective strategy for success and health in your life. If\n  you have not learned that, or if you don't have a positive attitude, this fact should be enough reason to\n  endeavor to adopt it. A positive attitude includes having positive expectations about the effects of your\n  actions. A positive attitude includes believing you can have an impact in your life"
