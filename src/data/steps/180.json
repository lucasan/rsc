The \"I\" that is reading this, is embedded in that old,    learned pattern. We have one advantage over the fish: we do have a choice! We rarely face this choice, instead, continuing with the same beliefs, thinking, and emotional reactions. It    is only during a crisis, sometimes referred to as the \"Dark night of the soul\", in which we feel like nothing    is working, that we take a closer look at how we have been running our lives. But you don't have to wait until    you are forced to let go and embrace a new approach. You can take control of your life now."
