    "content": "Everywhere you hear, “keep your distance\\\", “social isolation\\\", be safe. In this time of “no gatherings\\\" and\n      staying at home it’s a challenge to be in relationship. Yet, relationship is so important in our lives. We are\n      social beings. We develop in relationship to others; we thrive in part from the support and love that we share\n      with others. Positive relationships and positive social contact help us self-regulate physiologically. In facing\n      this crisis, we can lose sight of this fact."

If you are having a conflict, recognize that with all the other stresses in\n      your life, you don’t need to add to this by maintaining a conflict. Find a way to let go, forgive and resolve\n      anything getting in the way of loving and feeling warmly toward each other.",
