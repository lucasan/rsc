It’s hard to notice the progress with an individual brick, but a) with a regular process of\n      adding bricks (steps), the growth of the home – your life – starts to be noticed, and b) there is no other way to\n      build a beautiful home – or life.",

    "content": "Our PG patterns help to limit our growth by setting boundaries around what we consider to be “who I am\\\".\n      Behavior that we consider to be outside our boundaries we tend to avoid; sticking to the familiar that’s inside\n      the boundaries. Just as we also avoid behaviors that may expose us to emotional upsets – that are also outside our\n      boundaries. For example, we might avoid the experience of being awkward or experiences that expose us to failure.\n      Of course, this will make us more reluctant to try anything new."

  "action_step": "Let’s do something today that helps you get more comfortable with being uncomfortable. I’d like you to take some\n      of your routine behaviors – such as eating or brushing your hair and your teeth – and doing them with your\n      opposite hand. By taking some non-threatening behaviors and allowing yourself to experiment, you give yourself the\n      opportunity to be flexible. By using your opposite hand, you will experience an awkwardness that typically\n      accompanies new behaviors, and this will help you get OK with being awkward. Pay attention to how you feel when\n      you experience this discomfort. Remind yourself that it is a natural part of learning new behaviors.",
