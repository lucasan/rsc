    "content": "\"Dream big and dare to fail.\" Norman VaughanWhen the brains of risk takers are examined, it shows that their brains are wired differently. They can be\n            ready to walk a tightrope across the Grand Canyon, and the fear centers do not light up, as they would do\n            for anyone else. For most of us, risks and dangers are at the least, uncomfortable.It is helpful to make the decision that you are willing to pay a price for good things in your life and to\n            feel good. I’m not talking about risking life and limb, I’m talking about the risk of being judged, the risk\n            of making a mistake and not being perfect, or the risk of feeling uncomfortable. These are what I refer to\n            as necessary risks to being on The Path. Where the rewards are greater than these risks."
