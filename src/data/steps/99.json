    "content": "My ninth and last pillar of resilience and success is power - which I define as the ability to get things done.One way of breaking down life is into two categories: how to be in the moment in the best way, and how to moveforward in the best way. Doing both of these functions helps you be more resilient and achieve greatersuccess.Every time you take the challenge, every time you do something difficult - you grow your self-confidence, yourtrust in yourself, and your confidence. Each time you go beyond your comfort zone you show yourself somethingabout your grit, your toughness, and your courage. This is being on The Path. You can't do anything better toinsure a happy and successful life and most important - feeling good about yourself!"
