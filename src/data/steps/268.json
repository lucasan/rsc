    "content": "It’s easy to get caught up in the stresses of your daily life, and to experience them as a struggle. It can\n            be a struggle to survive, a struggle to deal with conflict, or a struggle to address a personal issue or\n            short-coming. The struggle can leave you feeling frustrated, sad, or simply drained. I have found one\n            variable that can positively modify these experiences: love. Even when it doesn’t seem to fit the\n            conversation, love can make a difference."

It can also mean be loving\n            toward yourself and be loving toward others. Notice if this focus, this preoccupation with a loving approach\n            to life, leaves less space for struggle.",
