    "content": "My ninth pillar of resilience is \"power\" which I define as the ability to get things done. In many ways this is  what leads to success. Today I invite you to identify aspects of your Primitive Gestalt Pattern - lessons from  childhood - that get in your way of taking important action. Being successful in getting things done helps you  gain greater confidence and trust in yourself. This increase in your sense of capacity results in fewer  situations causing you upset. This translates into resilience and success."

Does it make you uncomfortable to begin any of them? Are you afraid you might  make the wrong decision, or make a mistake? Are the actions needed a bit outside of your comfort zone? Do you  get distracted or find other easier tasks to do instead? Perhaps you have the habit of being a \"Monday morning  quarterback\" criticizing and finding what was wrong about what you did - after you did it. This can easily lead  to self-censoring your behavior. Today, identify your pattern. Next, we will take some steps to overcome these  obstacles.",
