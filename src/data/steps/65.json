    "content": "One source of emotional nourishment is taking in your successes. Acknowledging them and then owning your\n      abilities, skills and hard work supports healthy personal development. Sometimes this is referred to as\n      “resourcing\\\"; you are identifying your personal resources in order to feel grounded. Engaging in resourcing\n      actually helps you grow the very abilities you identify. As you grow in this way you increase your capacity to\n      handle difficult situations. This increase in capacity is an important aspect of resilience."

  "action_step": "Identify one of your strengths, something that you have demonstrated in the past, from which to anchor yourself.\n      You may not have noticed this strength if you put too much emphasis on your struggle, or if you have been very\n      critical of yourself. Frequently our criticism can mask our gifts.For others, you have learned to avoid patting yourself on the back for fear that this will lead to overconfidence,\n      a “swelled head\\\" or other such forms of inflation. But it is healthy to own your abilities. I’m not asking you to\n      shout this out to the world, but for you to simply and accurately appreciate your gifts.Once you have identified your strength, think of how it can serve you during this crisis (or perhaps it has\n      already been serving you). Think of how you can apply it to today’s challenge – and follow through. Once you do\n      this, you can expect that the result will be greater access to this ability in the future.",
