Use sitting down for a meal, or entering your home as cues,\n      indicating that you are safe and can let go. Get onto The Path of recovery today.“When the way comes to an end, then change.

    "content": "There are many ways being flexible helps you function at your best and enhances your resilience response. You can\n      be flexible in your perspective – shifting perspective to approach a situation differently and better problem\n      solve. It can refer to bending but not breaking, or to adjust your goals for greater success. Today I suggest that you be flexible about your view of yourself. Many of us hold outdated negative beliefs about\n      ourselves. They are based on inappropriate messages of childhood. The result is feeling like we are defective, not\n      OK, or don’t deserve. Once these self-assessments harden, they interfere with more recent experiences. In other\n      words, we ignore our achievements over many years, as we defer to early imprinted messages."
