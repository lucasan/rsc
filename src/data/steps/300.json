    "content": "We are all familiar with Newtonian physics. This is our everyday reality and experience, where time goes in\n  one direction, you can't be in two places at the same time and there is separation of observer from what's\n  observed. But there is another reality - quantum reality. On the quantum, or micro-reality level, these\n  rules of physics appear to break down. There is non-duality and the observer directly influences\n  reality.Science is still trying to figure how these two very different versions of reality come together. But on a\n  psychological level, I believe there is considerable overlap. Goals are more likely to be achieved when you\n  believe they are going to happen. You are more likely to achieve success when you believe in yourself. In\n  other words, your belief - and more specifically, your belief in yourself, leads to positive results,\n  success, and happiness."
