Don't complain.\\\" ― Maya AngelouThere are always reasons why something does or doesn’t happen. And we can always come up with excuses. There\n            are always others or circumstances to blame. The point of today’s step is not that these things are not\n            true, but that focusing on them doesn’t help you get the results you want. The best path for success, The\n            Path for success is to focus back on yourself, learn from your experience – what you can do different or\n            better - recommit, and re-engage. No Blame!"
