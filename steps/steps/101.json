We are continually faced with the judgments of others, until they\n      become our own judgments. At the same time, we try to push down, or hide what we don’t want others (or ourselves)\n      to see. We carry shame.It’s important to appreciate what you like about yourself while being aware – with minimal judgment - of what you\n      don’t like. Of what you don’t like, you work hard to improve, and what you can’t improve – accept! Ultimately,\n      it’s important to love yourself, warts and all. If you don’t, who will."

  "action_step": "First describe what you like about yourself. Take a moment to fully appreciate and take this in. As you do,\n      realize that you are giving yourself emotional nourishment. Next, identify something about yourself that you want\n      to address, further develop, or otherwise shift away from. Write about this in your journal – so you make it an\n      intention. And finally, identify something about yourself that you have been trying to shift but have not been\n      able to. For the moment, instead of beating yourself up about it, let go, have compassion toward yourself and\n      accept.",
