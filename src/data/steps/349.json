    "content": "Many years ago, sports psychologist and amateur weightlifter, Charles A. Garfield, during a world sports\n            competition, met after hours with a team from eastern Europe in a local gym. He was there to experience,\n            firsthand, some amazing claims of huge improvements in lifting in conjunction with visualization. Garfield,\n            who hadn’t lifted for a while, had a personal best of 250 pounds. He suggested that they should start at\n            about 225 pounds for the experiment.Prior to doing his lift, the team coach took him through a 15-minute visualization that Garfield described\n            as leaving him feeling refreshed and energized, and then had him lift the weight. With surprising ease, he\n            lifted the bar bell only to be told after he achieved this, that he actually lifted 285 pounds!Your mind and how you use it, can produce amazing results."
