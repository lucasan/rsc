    "content": "We are a society of comparers. We are always comparing ourselves to someone who has more or has done more,\n  or looks better, looks thinner or younger. We are more inclined to notice what we haven't done over what we\n  have done; what's wrong rather than what' right about ourselves. This approach adds to stress and hurts\n  self-confidence and sense of self. And it can cause us to procrastinate or interrupt progress toward our\n  goals.It's helpful to focus more on what we have done, and to appreciate the steps that we take. How do you avoid\n  feeling bad about what still needs to be done? This was my intention in developing the concept of \"The\n  Path\". Rather than focusing on the ultimate goal, or giving in to nervousness about what still needs to be\n  done, The Path, allows you to feel good as long as you are working toward your goals as well as good health\n  - the 9 pillars. If you identify the steps that you need to be taking, and then take those steps, this puts\n  you on The Path. Once on The Path you can rest easy, knowing that you are on The Path to success."
