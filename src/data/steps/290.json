By noticing them and labeling them as inappropriate, or wrong or undermining, helps you begin to\n            gain control over them and ultimately stop listening to them. This puts you on The Path. When you stop being\n            distracted and overwhelmed by these messages, you can begin to notice and identify your true needs.",
