    "content": "It might seem strange to be talking about the life you love during this terrible crisis we are all going\n            through. We are in lock down, unable to do so many of the things we enjoy. Many of us have been touched by\n            death and illness as well as economic hardship. It can be very daunting. While upset and upsetting feelings should not be ignored, it is also important to find a way to balance the\n            hardship with the reasons for being alive. I have talked about the value of positive emotions. Including how\n            they actually improve the functioning of your heart. I have also shared that the Dalai Lama has said that\n            the purpose of life is to be happy."
