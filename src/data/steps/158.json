    "content": "Numerous psychological experiments have demonstrated that personal bias determines how and what you perceive.  You are more likely to see what you are expecting to see and miss much of the environment in the process. This  limitation interferes with your resilience and success. In my supervision work for the doctoring program at  UCLA, we teach medical students how easy it is for bias to play a role in assessment and treatment. This can  happen because of the color of a patient's skin, their lack of money or a cultural orientation.Resilience is about a willingness to notice your own rigid beliefs and to be flexible and open to new ways of  thinking and believing, that take you beyond your existing boundaries."

Have you been open and flexible to new information? Have you been willing to listen  to people of color giving witness to their experiences? Has this caused you to examine your behavior, or make  shifts in your thinking and perhaps actions to be taken?",
