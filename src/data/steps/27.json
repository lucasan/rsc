    "content": "Some of you awaken in the morning and scan your day for what can go wrong. You might feel some discomfort in your\n      body – that feels like anxiety – and then unconsciously decide there must be something to be worried about. Others\n      might start the day with expectations of danger. All of these approaches create more stress in your lives, as your\n      body will go into the Fight or Flight\\\" response to prepare for danger – whether it’s real or imagined. It’s OK to take some time to plan for all possible eventualities of the day, but once you do this planning, you\n      want to focus on positive expectations. Positive expectations help your body more effectively cope with stress and\n      manage valuable body resources. Those who have positive expectations are more resilient."
