    "content": "It's difficult to experience true thriving in life if you are focused on surviving! If you consider the full\n  range of life's experience - and then find the midpoint - everything below is about survival, while\n  everything above is about fully living in happiness. You don't consciously make the choice, but many of you\n  dwell in the lower half of this range of life.If you start your day wondering what can go wrong - you are choosing the lower half. If your unspoken goal\n  is for things to simply be OK, you are dwelling below the midline. If you are afraid to expect good things\n  to happen because you don't want to be disappointed, you are living below the line.To live above the line, you first must make this choice. \"I want to thrive, not just survive.\" \"I want and\n  I deserve to be happy and have good things in my life!\" These are decisions that start you focusing above\n  the line."
