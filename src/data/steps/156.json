We might distract ourselves, push the\n        feelings down, change the subject, rationalize, or decide it’s not important enough. Much of the time this\n        defense happens before we even have awareness of our feelings. For example, if we learn in childhood that we\n        shouldn’t get angry or shouldn’t cry, rather than be uncomfortable with a reaction judged to be wrong, we cut\n        off our awareness even before noticing."

When feelings are buried, it may take some detective work to\n        bring them to the surface and into your awareness.
