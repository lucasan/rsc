    "content": "Yesterday I encouraged you to identify one of your strengths to use and further develop in order to meet thechallenge of today's crisis. Sometimes it's just as important to get out of your own way. By this I'm referring toa habit, belief or judgment that interferes with or takes away from your effectiveness. Your internal voice, orinternal parent might be quick to notice what you are doing wrong, pointing out your mistakes instead of what youdid well. It might have the tendency for catastrophic expectations - imagining the worst outcome. This focus onthe negative impedes your ability to think clearly and with flexibility to better problem solve. It constrictsoptions and causes you to hesitate, avoid or shrink from opportunity.I find that many of my clients have an unreasonable expectation that they should be able to do anything theyattempt perfectly without a mistake. This contributes to procrastination and makes it more difficult to moveforward as you fear the resulting judgments."
