Or maybe you applied this idea to how you were feeling? Any increase in\n            flexibility put you on The Path.",

    "content": "Tikkun Olam, is one of the core Jewish cultural values. It refers to “healing or repairing the world,\\\" and\n            originates in the idea that the world is a fractured place – which we can see all around us – and it’s the\n            mission of every individual to both fix and elevate it. This perspective supports the aspiration to behave\n            and act constructively and beneficially toward the welfare of society at large. For many contemporary\n            pluralistic rabbis, the term refers to “Jewish social justice.\\\" When you personally act in this way, you take your mind off your own problems. You support a positive\n            belief in yourself that strengthens self-value and self-efficacy. And, whether you believe it or not, what\n            you send out into the world, will, in some way, come back to you. Some refer to this as “Karma\\\" and relates\n            to the interconnectedness of the entire Universe."
