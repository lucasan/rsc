    "content": "Why “keep stillness inside of you\\\"? One of the goals of life is to be in balance: physical, emotional, and\n        mental balance. The stresses of life are always pushing us out of balance and resilience is about the ability to\n        recover that balance. We all perform better when in balance and we deal with stress better when we know how to\n        regain that balance. Finding stillness is at the heart of being in balance."

  "action_step": "Take 10 minutes today to find and cultivate stillness inside. During those 10 minutes, do the following:1. Create your psychological space by turning off your phone and computer and make sure you will not be\n        disturbed.2. Remind yourself that you are safe, that nothing needs to be done during these 10 minutes3. Get comfortable and shift into your six breaths per minute breathing pattern.4. At the end of each exhale, notice that your level of calmness becomes greater (if you have been engaged in\n        stressful behavior, it might take a number of minutes before you begin to notice some calmness; have\n        patience).5. Sit for a few minutes in this calm state of stillness.",
