    "content": "One thing that peak performers - in sports, business or the arts - know, is that the more they are present and, inthe moment, the better their performance. Any distraction takes them out of being present. When we carry aroundemotional unfinished business - feelings that haven't been addressed or resolved - it distracts us. There isalways a part of us unconsciously being pulled by what needs to be addressed and resolved. This can be referred toas \"excess baggage\" we carry around."

  "action_step": "Identify emotional baggage, or unfinished business that you are carrying around related to someone you know. Itmight be a minor upset or disagreement. It might be something more important: not feeling heard or accepted. Youhave two choices to get resolution: speaking to this person and expressing your feelings or having an imaginaryconversation in which you express your feelings.It's important to realize that you don't need the other person to actually hear or agree with you to getresolution, because what's unfinished are the feelings you are carrying that need to be expressed! Therefore, youcan resolve issues even with people who are no longer in your life. After all, we can never guarantee the behavioror response of someone else. So, if you are needing their agreement, you will never let go of your feelings.Let's imagine that the person you are carrying unfinished emotional business is sitting with you. Connect to yourfeelings and express them. What will make a difference in whether you are able to let go or not is based on youaccepting that this person may not ever respond the way you would want. This is important in order to not reignitethese feelings if it happens again. Express your feelings (you might also choose to write a letter that you don'tsend) and then let go. Remember, you are letting go not to let them off the hook, but to let yourself off the hookof having these feelings continue to affect you.",
