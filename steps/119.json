That’s where the fruit is.\\\" – Jimmy CarterStep of the Day: Make the decision to never be defeated (Pillar #9)We know it’s impossible to always win; to always do it correctly; to always avoid mistakes. The more you venture\n      out in life, the more opportunity for success … as well as defeat. But what’s important is that you don’t allow\n      any defeat to either stop you or demoralize you; get you down.In biofeedback a person receives continual feedback as to whether their physiology is going in the right direction\n      (such as less muscle tension) or wrong direction (greater tension). The training consists of learning what it\n      takes to get your physiology going in the right direction while learning not to do what sends it in the other\n      direction (such as tensing a muscle). But there is something to be learned when it goes in either direction.The decision to never be defeated is also about an attitude. It’s an attitude of never giving up. Sure, you may\n      need to adjust your goals for greater chance of success, but you are still going for it."
