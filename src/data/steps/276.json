    "content": "\"The purpose of our lives is to be happy.\" Dalai LamaIt’s easy, especially during this year, to be caught up in problems, fears, worries and, well, just\n            “stuff\\\". During difficult and dangerous times, the tendency is to be on guard and preoccupied by what needs\n            to be taken care of. The things that bring us joy and happiness frequently take a back seat. Pillar number 8\n            of The Path is flexibility. This means being able to pivot and experience joy, even during a pandemic, or\n            economic distress. Finding your life rhythm that gives you sustenance and recovery."
