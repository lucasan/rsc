We follow the direction that was given to us growing up. But we don’t\n          know any better or different. It’s all we know. The “I\\\" that is reading this, is embedded in that old,\n          learned pattern. We have one advantage over the fish: we do have a choice! We rarely face this choice, instead, continuing with the same beliefs, thinking, and emotional reactions. It\n          is only during a crisis, sometimes referred to as the “Dark night of the soul\\\", in which we feel like nothing\n          is working, that we take a closer look at how we have been running our lives. But you don’t have to wait until\n          you are forced to let go and embrace a new approach. You can take control of your life now."
