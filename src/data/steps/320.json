It’s a normal aspect to how you approach the challenges of life.\n            Resistance is fueled by your doubts: about yourself, about others and about the forces of the universe. It’s\n            that simple. It’s fueled by your judgments: about yourself, about others and about the judgments you project\n            onto other people (what you imagine THEY judge you about). Even though these judgments may be experienced as\n            protecting you (stopping you from getting into danger) they most often simply create a drag, or resistance\n            to you doing what’s difficult but necessary for progress and your success.This resistance is part of – the voice of - your Primitive Gestalt Pattern. It’s judgments and negative\n            expectations translate into resistance."
