    "content": "You did not decide on your beliefs; they were instilled in you. That sounds like you had no decision making\n  in the process and it's true. Fritz Perls used the term, \"introjected\" to describe the process. He would\n  say, when you are young you take in the messages, lessons of your childhood - without chewing them - and you\n  \"swallow them whole\". Then, in therapy, you bring them up and for the first time you chew on them. And\n  decide if you like the way they taste. If you don't (if the lesson doesn't support you), you spit it out. If\n  you like it, you digest/take it in.Your beliefs are not automatically right. As adults you can examine the beliefs running your life. You take\n  control over your life by independently deciding on the most effective beliefs as your operating system."

  "action_step": "Identify a belief - about yourself, about others or about the world - that would result in you being less\n  fearful and less defensive. For example, \"I am competent\", or \"People generally like me\", or \"It's okay to\n  make a mistake, that I then learn from\". When you make this shift, you will reduce your stress, enhance\n  your resilience and think and perform better.",
