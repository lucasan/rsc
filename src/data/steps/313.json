    "content": "You have probably heard the expression, doing the same thing and expecting different results is the\n  definition of insanity. Yet, in many ways this is how we lead our lives. I conceptualize this as the\n  unspoken and unconscious boundaries we establish around ourselves. What is inside the boundary identifies\n  what we are ok with and what's outside the boundary includes everything we believe is wrong, or difficult,\n  or dangerous. The boundary identifies our beliefs and our rules - what we allow of our behavior and\n  thinking.These boundaries, learned as part of our childhood lessons, are not necessarily good and they only serve to\n  limit us. Resilience is about the ability to continually adapt to new situations in life. Our boundaries\n  limit this ability to adapt."
