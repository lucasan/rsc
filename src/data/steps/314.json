    "content": "It's easy to get so absorbed in your own life, in your own struggle, in your own stresses that you miss\n  what's going on around you. When this happens, it feels like you don't have any spare energy or time for\n  others. Frequently when I'm working with a couple, particularly during difficult times, the anger and\n  resentment is about what each is not getting from the other. These are patterns based in scarcity; a feeling\n  that there isn't enough to go around.When the focus shifts to helping others, to giving support and care and sending love and energy out,\n  miracles seem to happen. The two miracles that I always notice are 1) there is a feeling of relief and\n  satisfaction, and 2) I come in contact with a sense of abundance - that there is more available than before.\n  And this abundance might be emotional abundance or material abundance."
