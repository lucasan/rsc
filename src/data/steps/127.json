    "content": "Enhancing your ability to recover from stress - and slow your aging (Pillar #4)There are many ways in which the 365 Steps program helps your body age more slowly and gracefully. Appreciate  all your efforts as they have long lasting effects.Your body has two basic choices: protect and defend, when there is danger, or heal, maintain, and grow, when  there isn't danger. Since your body doesn't have unlimited resources, it's always making choices as to where to  send energy. The more you are in the defend mode - your stress response - the less energy is available for  recovery. Research has demonstrated that too much stress speeds up aging."

  "action_step": "The best way to help your body go into the recovery mode, in which it supports healthy aging, is to do a daily  relaxation exercise. In my free audio download, available on my website, I guide you through an exercise  designed to have you breathing at the very specific rate - approximately 6 breaths per minute or 10 seconds for  one breathing cycle - that literally enhances neuroplasticity and healthy brain functioning. It also engages  your parasympathetic nervous system, which is necessary for recovery. It's important to do 10-20 minutes of this  relaxation daily. Do it today! And when you do, remind yourself before you start, that you are safe, which helps  your body fully let go and relax.",
