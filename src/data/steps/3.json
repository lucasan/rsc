  "review_and_appreciate": "Review and Appreciate: Reflect on how well you implemented step 2. Did you examine your motivation levels to embark on The Path? Commend yourself if you took action. This positivity builds your self-confidence and reinforces your deservingness of the results. If you didn't act, don't self-reproach. Instead, identify obstacles, remind yourself why you're on The Path, and then make a belated effort. Acknowledge your recovery and follow-through, or consider your ongoing resistance and desire to walk The Path. We will address self-sabotage in later steps.",

This differs from past efforts as we're aiming for a higher level, requiring fresh thought patterns and behaviors. We aim to break free from your Primitive Gestalts - inherited modes of thinking and acting. These patterns act like a gravitational force, pulling you back into old habits. By taking gradual steps on The Path, you'll build momentum to break free from your Primitive Gestalt Pattern, leading to unprecedented growth and achievement."

Commit to periodically reviewing this document for support. Sign it with full awareness, intent, and self-love."
