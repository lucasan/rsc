    "title": "Addressing Unresolved Emotional Matters (Pillar #6)",
    "content": "Gestalt means 'whole', and our minds and bodies strive for this wholeness. A study by German Gestalt Psychologists showed how unfulfilled needs influence our perception and behavior. Unresolved emotional issues usually stem from childhood and manifest in two ways: 1) unfulfilled needs for love, acceptance, attention, and validation, and 2) unexpressed emotions held back to avoid feeling overwhelmed or fear of rejection. These unaddressed needs and emotions don't disappear over time and can unknowingly influence our behavior, causing problems. A sign of unresolved emotional business is an overreaction to a situation, indicating underlying unprocessed feelings."
