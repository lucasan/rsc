    "content": "“To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.\\\"― Ralph Waldo EmersonThis is a theme I keep coming back to. Being satisfied with who you are instead of what others want you to be is\n      comforting and grounding. It reduces anxiety and self-doubt. However, as Mr. Emerson alludes to – being yourself\n      is very difficult to accomplish or even to know. The subtle process of being rewarded for meeting the expectations\n      of others right from birth, guides you in a different direction. You learn to satisfy the image others have for\n      you. Even if their intentions are good – it’s usually not who you are, but who they feel you should be.Each step you take in owning and accepting who you are – separate from those teachings – helps you cope better and\n      be more resilient."
