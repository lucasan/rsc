Remember, it’s a work in progress. However, you were\n      able to feel into this state, appreciate your effort.",

    "content": "Life is about relationships. You live in relationship to others, and you engage in relationships daily. You are,\n      above everything else, a social being! New research is demonstrating that your interactions with others help\n      regulate or dysregulate your nervous system and your emotions. All of your interpersonal interactions have the\n      potential to trigger emotions – emotions that enrich and foster resilience or emotions that are toxic, and\n      everything in between. How close, how safe, and secure you feel in your relationships plays a role in your health. My second pillar on The Path is about bringing awareness and health to your relationships, so they support you\n      and contribute to your well-being. And when they are not supportive, you can recognize that and take action, so\n      they don’t drain energy and personal resources."

  "action_step": "Think of a person in your life with whom your relationship is mostly positive and without any conﬂicting feelings.\n      Of course, no relationship is perfect, but think of one that comes close. Take a moment to picture that person in\n      the room with you. Imagine the person in as much detail as possible. Notice how you feel as you picture him or\n      her. Do you ﬁnd that you’re feeling good, feeling calm? Perhaps thinking about this person puts a smile on your\n      face. You would probably say that being in the presence of this person helps you feel safe and lowers your stress\n      level. This relationship can allow your body to take a break and restore needed resources, energizing you and\n      enhancing your resilience.",
