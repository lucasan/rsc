There is the story of the two lumberjacks. The first\n            worked so hard every day. Working non-stop from 8 in the morning to 6 at night. For his efforts there was a\n            big stack of cut wood. The second lumberjack also started chopping at 8 in the morning. But every hour he\n            took a break. He too finished at 6 in the evening. Next to him was an even larger pill of wood, almost\n            double that of the first.Every hour, when he took a break, he sharpened his ax."
