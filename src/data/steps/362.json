Let's take a few minutes to reflect and\n  identify some of the important \"steps\" or lessons and actions that have benefitted you over this past\n  year.As you review, there might be the tendency to focus on how you didn't follow through - the negative. The\n  healthy way of experiencing your life and performance is to first appreciate what you did right, what you\n  learned. Next is to identify what behaviors didn't support you or where you made mistakes. From that\n  awareness your goal would be to commit to how you can think and act more effectively in the future."
