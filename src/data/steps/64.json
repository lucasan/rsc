    "content": "When there is an extreme change in nature, it spurs greater evolutionary change. “Necessity is the mother of\n      invention.\\\" But not all species meet the challenge and adapt; some learn how to thrive, and others do not\n      survive. Today’s new reality offers us the same challenge to grow and adapt. We have two choices during this\n      global environment. One choice is to “hunker down\\\", to anxiously hold on and try to weather the storm. The other\n      approach is to rise to the occasion. By taking this challenge you mobilize and strengthen your “will\\\", your\n      personal drive and self-confidence."

  "action_step": "Today, approach your personal situation from this perspective of embracing the challenge. Earlier “steps\\\" have\n      discussed reaching deeper inside yourself. This is a developmental process that everyone can engage. In this\n      process be accepting of yourself and your limitations. But rather than focusing on these weaknesses, think about\n      becoming stronger in order to grow, learn and handle the challenges.",
