    "content": "In the process of biofeedback, in which you monitor some aspect of a person’s physiology – such as muscle\n          tension – and feedback (thus, biofeedback) that information so the person learns to lower tension, the\n          information supports the learning process. The information is helpful whether the tension goes down or goes\n          up. In other words, when it goes in the wrong direction you are learning what you do that doesn’t reduce\n          tension.In life and when you are doing something new or different, you also won’t always get it right. But like the\n          biofeedback process, you want to frame your experiences as giving you important information helping you\n          continue to learn and discover the best approach – even when you make a mistake or get negative feedback from\n          your environment. When you do this, you make it easier to move forward, persevere and continue on your journey\n          toward success."
