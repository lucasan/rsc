    "title": "Today live and act from a place of love. Ground your day, thoughts and actions from a place of love (Pillars #1, 2, 3, & 6).",
    "content": "There are so many reasons to ground yourself in a place of love. For starters, it makes sense from a health\n  perspective. Love and other positive emotions such as gratitude, actually help your heart and your nervous\n  system function better. It fosters greater balance between the two branches of your nervous system and\n  encourages greater heart rate variability, which supports healthy heart function. I've discussed this in\n  previous steps.From an emotional perspective, going into a place of love is emotionally soothing. In my own experience,\n  when I've been in emotionally painful places, focusing on loving feelings - including loving myself - has\n  shifted my emotional state. Helping me feel a sense of relief.And finally, when I come from a place of love - even in business relationships - it yields much more\n beneficial results."
