    "title": "Resilience and immune system functioning",
    "content": "Resilience enhances your ability to ward off infection. There is considerable evidence that stress impairs immunesystem functioning. For example, one study found a decrease in natural killer cell activity when subjects wereunder greater stress. Natural killer cells are those that can bind to and kill certain tumor cells andvirus-infected cells. In another study, men and women who were chronically stressed by caring for a spouse withdementia, showed clear deficits in both their cellular and humoral immune responses to an influenza-virus vaccinecompared with well- matched control individuals who were not care-givers. In other words, mastering your stresswill support optimum immune system functioning. Managing stress means reducing the number of times you activate your body with the stress response, quicklyturning off the response after a stress is over and giving your body the opportunity to recover."

  "action_step": "Here are today's steps for you to take:1. Notice assumptions of danger you make that activate your nervous system. For example, if you haven't heard fromsomeone, you might jump to the conclusion that they are upset with you. (Remember, your stress response preparesyou for immediate threats - real or imagined - by mobilizing you to either fight or run from the danger.) Thenthink of an alternative, as well as a more positive assumption that you can replace it with. This will help loweryour physiological arousal.2. Find time today and every day to practice your relaxation exercise. This retrains your body to turn down stressactivation. Here is a link to my free exercise that you can download:http://drstephensideroff.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Sideroff-Relaxation.m4a3. We typically fail to take note when a stressful experience is over, thus our bodies don't turn off the stressresponse. Said another way, we don't take note when we don't have to act stressed. Today, notice as many times aspossible, when you don't need to mobilize your body, that you can give it a break - and tell yourself it's okay tobe calm.4. Sleep is the best time and source of recovery. Make sure you are getting enough sleep.5. When you prepare for sleep, remind yourself that you are safe and can let go into a deep sleep to restore vitalbody resources (such as neurotransmitters in the brain).",
