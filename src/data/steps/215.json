Do you automatically go into what can get in your way, what can go wrong, or\n  worry about the judgments of others or not succeeding?Every choice has positive and negative aspects and uncertainty. When you choose your path, you are choosing\n  that path with the greatest likelihood of success, with the greatest ratio of positive to negative aspects.\n  There will always be a negative with any choice. An Olympic athlete once said, when asked if she thought\n  about crashing in her slalom competition, \"if I did, I don't think I'd ever compete. I certainly wouldn't\n  win.\""
