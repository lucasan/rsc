    "content": "These are difficult and stressful times with considerable uncertainty. Yesterday I emphasized the importance of\n        being kind to yourself while also being kind to others. Let’s focus on being kind to others today. And start\n        with those closest to you. In particular, the people you are isolating with – in most cases this is family.\n        Living in close quarters with limited diversions can be like a slow water torture. You might be making the best\n        of the situation and trying to accommodate but living and working on top of each other can challenge any\n        relationship."

Let them know that you appreciate any accommodation they have been making to\n        support your needs and ask if there is anything you can do to support them.",
