    "content": "We are all dealing with major changes in our lives right now; significant changes in our lifestyle, in our\n      outlets for coping and experiencing satisfaction. It’s a time when adaptability and adjustment are being demanded\n      of us. In past steps I’ve suggested that our ability to adapt was frozen to some degree during our childhood. We\n      adapted to those lessons, but then we got stuck with many of them.Today I’d like to suggest an action step designed to help reignite your ability to adapt to the present moment. A\n      step that will also help you with the discomfort that frequently accompanies new approaches and new behaviors."

  "action_step": "Today I’d like you to do some of your routine behaviors with your opposite hand. If you use your right hand to\n      pick up your fork, use your left. If you brush your teeth with your left hand, use your right. As a new behavior,\n      this will feel both uncomfortable and difficult. You might notice a tendency to want to give up; that being\n      awkward is too uncomfortable, or due to the judgments you are making. Stick with it. Stick with it long enough to\n      notice you are becoming less uncomfortable. Stick with it long enough to notice some improvement in your results.You are engaging your ability to adapt, to learn something new. You are developing your ability to be flexible.",
