At those moments, were you able to remember a\n  more effective approach that you are holding an intention about? This puts you on The Path and supports the\n  development of new brain pathways.",

    "content": "I have been emphasizing the notion of choice points throughout your day. Places in which you typically\n  follow your old ways of thinking and doing - your habit patterns. When you set an intention for healthier\n  ways of proceeding - based on your healthy internal parent - it helps you notice these choice points. While\n  the goal is to make new choices, sometimes this is still difficult. But what can be possible is simply\n  having the awareness of these choice points and the inappropriateness of the old pattern."

Those moments in which you\n  automatically think negatively, are self-critical or avoid taking a necessary action. Awareness is a\n  powerful tool in and of itself. It helps you face life instead of withdrawing or avoiding. So today notice\n  your choice points.",
