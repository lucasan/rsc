    "content": "There are some steps in this process that are important to keep coming back to. One of these is taking time forappreciation. As you can see how many of my pillars of resilience and success are affected by this process. Whenyou appreciate, you can feel a sense of love, thus literally changing and supporting your physiology (feelings ofgratitude improve your heart rate variability pattern, a fundamental measure of health). It helps connect you withothers, it sends out positive feelings that can support others. And it contributes to balancing out the stressfulfeelings generated by today's crisis."

  "action_step": "Think of whom you appreciate. Picture that person or persons and hold them close to you as you feel a sense ofgratitude. As you do this, also focus on your heart, breath through your heart and allow the positive feelings toconnect with your heart. Breath four seconds in and six seconds out - the breathing frequency (Six breaths perminute) that enhances heart rate coherence and positive physiology. Do this with others in your life or even forthe care givers who are risking their lives for others. Simply take a few minutes to go through this process ofappreciation and gratitude and allow these positive feelings to move through your body, creating a calming andhealing effect.",
