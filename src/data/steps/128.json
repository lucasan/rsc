    "content": "Affirmations are “as if” statements, aspirations written as if they already exist or already have happened. If\n        you want to be true to your word but have difficulty following through, you would write: “When I commit to\n        taking action, I always follow through.” You would then say this state- ment out loud throughout your day.\n        When you make such a statement, a few things happen to facilitate becoming the person you view through that\n        statement. First, you keep hearing it—reminding yourself to follow through. Second, your brain keeps hearing it.\n        Your brain can’t hear it without creating neural circuits representing the statement. In addition, you are not\n        comfortable with “cognitive dissonance.” You are not comfortable saying or hearing any statement that disagrees\n        with reality. This motivates you to make the statement true. Finally, by repeating this statement, you are\n        creating a dress rehearsal for reality. This makes it easier to do in real life."

  "action_step": "Identify something in your behavior or belief about yourself that is important to you and that you have been\n        struggling with—perhaps a greater follow-through with what you say you want. Turn this into an Affirmation\n        statement. Read and speak this statement—out loud—when you awaken, before every meal, and again before you go to\n        sleep. When you read the statement, take a moment to breathe, meditate on it, and even visualize it already\n        happening.",
