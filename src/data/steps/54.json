    "title": "Neuroplasticity versus clinging to your old patterns (Pillars #1 & 8)",
    "content": "We have two very powerful forces working inside us. One serves to help us face challenges and new realities by\n      making us optimally adaptive. This is our brain’s gift of neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is how our brains learn\n      from new experience. Even a one-hour impactful experience triggers new nerve growth in our brains. D.O. Hebb\n      originally referred to this as “neurons that fire together, wire together\\\". But juxtaposed to this helpful\n      function is what I’ve termed, our “Primitive Gestalt Patterns\\\" (PGP). These are lessons, habits and fears\n      developed during childhood – before we had the ability to choose if we wanted these lessons or not. Many of them\n      lock us into thinking and behaviors that no longer serve us. Yet, because they were developed as part of our\n      survival learning as a child, they are very resistant to change. We can say that our ability to adapt has been\n      frozen to the environment of our childhood. The current crisis demands that we be open to new learning so we can most appropriately adapt and adjust."

  "action_step": "Your PGP’s are ensconced in the voice you hear 24/7. Today, pay attention to the messages you are hearing. Notice\n      what fears it is telling you, what negative messages or what self-judgments you are hearing in your head. Also,\n      notice the catastrophic expectations. Whenever you notice this voice, take a moment to hear your healthy internal\n      parent. From this place, set a boundary between you and the negative voice and take in the positive message from\n      your healthy internal parent.",
