    "title": "Building Confidence and Self-trust (Pillar #9)",
    "content": "Faith is a powerful force. In the words of Jesus, those with faith can move mountains. However, you can interpret 'faith' as self-confidence and trust. If you lack confidence, you might seek external validation. When working with athletes, I often hear, 'I lost my confidence' after a poor performance. I remind them that true confidence isn't lost so easily. Confidence is not innate; it's developed. Some of us were lucky to have supportive parents who fostered our confidence. Nevertheless, most of us have suffered some damage to our confidence. The only effective way to build confidence is by fulfilling your commitments. You grow confidence by embracing life's challenges, persisting, and acknowledging your achievements while striving for improvement. This journey teaches you to trust and believe in yourself, which is the foundation of confidence. There are no shortcuts or tricks to gaining confidence."

  "action_step": "Choose a task you've been avoiding due to fear, uncertainty, or lack of knowledge. Reframe this task as a 'challenge' rather than a 'problem'. Break down the challenge into manageable parts to make the process easier. Allow yourself to make mistakes, as they're part of learning. Focus more on the effort than the outcome. This exercise will contribute to the development of Pillar #9 - Power. Make time today to take action.",
