You can steer yourself any direction you\n            choose.\" Dr. Seuss.You have brains in your head, as Dr. Seuss recognizes. If you want to take control of them, you need to\n            steer them and your feet onto The Path. I define The Path as living each moment of your life in the most\n            optimal way. This optimal way is laid out in my nine pillars of resilience. But since there are many\n            ingredients and actions that contribute to this (after all there are 9 pillars to my model of resilience and\n            success), you need a framework and methodology so that the process isn’t overwhelming. At any time, if you\n            take “a\\\" step toward your goal, based on my model, that puts you on The Path. Once you are on The Path, you\n            can breathe a sigh of relief – without worrying about what’s not getting done."
