    "content": "You have a “public self\\\". That’s the image you portray to the world. It’s your best effort to be accepted\n            and successful. It’s your best imitation of what you think others are most likely to approve. Too often,\n            however, this includes hiding the self – or aspects of yourself - you are ashamed of or afraid will be\n            negatively judged by others. Integrity, that maintains resilience, is to have inner and outer selves match.\n            This is within your reach.The two keys to integrity:1. Aspire to be the person you want to be and want people to see.2.When you reach for this level of excellence, accept, and appreciate yourself."

If you want to achieve\n            excellence, as of this second, quit doing less-than-excellent work. Make this your credo for today.",
