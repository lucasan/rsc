    "content": "In the last two days we have covered physical recovery or bouncing back and emotional recovery and finishing\n      unfinished business. The next pillar you need to pay attention to is your thinking pattern. And I want to begin by\n      identifying unproductive or destructive thinking. One area of this is not being able to let go of something that\n      didn’t go your way. Sometimes it’s a mistake you made, which we have discussed, but a lot of the time it is\n      wishing past events were different. It’s easy to get upset because things didn’t go your way. Especially when the\n      outcomes may be very different – between a success and a failure.No matter how close you came, or negative the outcome, or simply uncomfortable, letting go of thinking that is not\n      getting you anywhere is important to your success and your resilience. We can even come up with excuses for\n      dwelling on a mistake, for example, “I want to figure how to do it better.\\\" While this is a reasonable desire, if\n      it doesn’t happen in a few minutes, it never will!"
