    "content": "What’s your number one goal in life? Instinctually it’s to survive. You don’t have a say in the matter, the\n            imperative is buried deep in the most primitive parts of your brain and nervous system. But this dominance\n            can hold you back and can also get corrupted by lessons of childhood.These lessons get internalized and held by your internal parent, or what I’ve been referring to as the\n            spokesperson of your Primitive Gestalt Pattern. This voice wants to protect you at all costs. But it judges\n            this need to protect, based on an outmoded and typically negative set of judgments about you and your\n            “lacks.\\\" When you have a more negative self-view, there is a greater need to protect. And a larger view of\n            danger and what can go wrong."
