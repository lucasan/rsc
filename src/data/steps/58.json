    "title": "Step of the Day:\n      Grounding yourself (Pillar #1)",
    "content": "Grounding implies solidness. It can refer to a foundation, roots or anything else that might give you security.\n      Today, more than ever, it’s important to cultivate your ability to find this internal solidness. The expression\n      “grounding yourself\\\" is a way to find some stability, support; a way of anchoring yourself – in a healthy place.\n      This enhances confidence in yourself – pillar #1. In other words, it helps you get onto “The Path\\\". Much of the time we look outside ourselves for this grounding. We want someone else to do it for us – to support\n      us. Perhaps we feel it’s too difficult to do ourselves. You will never feel a true sense of security until you look inside, reach inside, to strengthen your own\n      foundation. When you look outside yourself you can never be certain that the support you seek will be there. This\n      fosters anxiety. When you develop it from the inside, it will always be there and there is comfort in this\n      awareness."
