You don't have the regular contacts that are part of\n  the automatic nature of daily activities or many of the usual reasons for coming together, such as holidays,\n  meetings, classes and other events. Instead it's necessary to recognize the importance of these\n  relationships and be proactive in connecting with them.Relationships are a source of support as well as what I refer to as \"emotional nourishment\" that nurture\n  your resilience."
