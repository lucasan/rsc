By noticing them and labeling them as inappropriate, or wrong or undermining, helps you begin to\n            gain control over them and ultimately stop listening to them. This puts you on The Path. When you stop being\n            distracted and overwhelmed by these messages, you can begin to notice and identify your true needs.",

    "content": "There is an amazing interplay between your thinking and your emotions. If you think you shouldn’t feel a certain way, you ignore the feeling, and it never gets resolved. If you think that someone is upset with you, it can make you anxious. If you think you can’t handle a situation, you will become tense, worried, and distracted. \n The direction of your thoughts determines the direction of your feelings. Positive thoughts/expectations usually lead to positive emo- tions. Negative thoughts will lead to anxiety or depression. During these difficult, uncertain times, this tendency will become magnified. And you will then justify this position, even though it doesn’t serve you."
