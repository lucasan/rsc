Remember, in this process, a step is taken when you make the effort, even if you haddifficulty and even if - for the moment - you were not able to fully let go. Simply make note of what got in yourway, so this can be addressed in another step on The Path.",

    "content": "\"As I wrote this \"step of the day\" I debated whether it should focus on your relationship with someone else, oryour relationship with yourself. After all, judgments will interfere with both relationships. Love is a feelingthat can be delicate. When you have a judgment - or ongoing judgments - this will create a negative feeling thatdistances you from the feelings of love. In fact, you might even notice a resistance to embrace someone with whomyou are critical.If we focus on your relationship with yourself, these judgments will interfere with feeling like you deserve; withyour efforts to be good to yourself; and even in reaching your goals."

  "action_step": "Today's step will focus on your relationship with yourself. Tomorrow we will address another of yourrelationships. Identify one of your judgments of yourself that is getting in your way of feeling good aboutyourself; getting in the way of loving yourself and treating yourself better. Today, give yourself permission tolet go of the judgment. If this is difficult, start by making a 24-hour holiday from judgment; a 24-hourexperiment with being accepting of yourself. Next, from this place of acceptance, actively engage in a process ofloving yourself. Do this by saying to yourself - out loud - \"I love you ____. I appreciate you. You deserve goodthings in your life. I want you to be happy.\" Take another moment to simply sit back and let yourself take inthese messages. Use them to support yourself throughout the day today.",
