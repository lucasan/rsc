This puts you squarely on The Path.",

    "content": "Take a positive attitude today to lift your spirits (Pillar #5)Yesterday’s step of being mindful and present in your life has multiple benefits. At the top of the list is your\n        ability to notice your habits that don’t serve you or support your growth and success. In the process of\n        mindfulness and being present, you have the opportunity to confront these old patterns that cause upset, without\n        any upside.One of these is the tendency to have negative expectations; to first think of what can go wrong. In this way you\n        create two problems for yourself: 1) you create a tendency to feel anxious, distracted and even avoid anything\n        that has a negative attachment to it, and 2) it adds an unnecessary obstacle in your path."
