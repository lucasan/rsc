    "content": "\"Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.\" Helen KellerMy fifth pillar of resilience is mental balance and mastery. This means recognizing that you have a choice\n            in how you look at (perspective) and deal with (agency) each situation you experience in life. It means you\n            consider what the best cognitive strategy is, rather than simply settling for the strategy you were taught\n            and learned from your childhood environment.The optimal strategy includes:1. Viewing situations as challenges to be overcome, rather than problems to be fearful of or shrink\n            from.2. Focusing on what needs to be done, rather than why it will be difficult or can’t be done, or what can get\n            in the way. In other words, a positive approach.3. Coming from a place of, “Whatever it takes, I’ll reach inside to find the power and energy to get it\n            done. I won’t give up.\\\" I’ll be persistent.4. What can I learn from this situation to support my personal growth and development and helping me be more\n            effective for the next challenge? Committed to your personal development."
