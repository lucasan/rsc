    "content": "We grow up trying to fit into expectations. We are continually faced with the judgments of others, until theybecome our own judgments. At the same time, we try to push down, or hide what we don't want others (or ourselves)to see. We carry shame.It's important to appreciate what you like about yourself while being aware - with minimal judgment - of what youdon't like. Of what you don't like, you work hard to improve, and what you can't improve - accept! Ultimately,it's important to love yourself, warts and all. If you don't, who will."
