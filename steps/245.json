And this determines how\n            resilient and successful you will be. The Dalai Lama’s observation is both accurate and sad, that we tend to\n            treat ourselves more negatively.Self-compassion is like an emotional “balm\\\" that soothes our wounds and our mistakes. It thus helps us\n            recover from the slings and arrows of life. Those who think that being hard on themselves results in better\n            performance are operating under a painful illusion that has the opposite result, leaving us feeling less\n            worthy and beaten down."
