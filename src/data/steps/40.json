    "content": "Today all of us are faced with the uncertainty and danger of the Corona Virus. While this is specific to March of\n      2020, it serves as a good example of how to handle real dangers. Right now, we can see a wide range of responses\n      from panic to keeping your head in the sand and hoping the danger goes away. So, here are the main points of\n      dealing with real dangers:Stay calm for best results: panic and worry actually leave you less capable of handling dangers, as they mobilize\n      your body, using precious body resources, while not making you any safer. In addition, they also shift cognitive\n      control from your cortex where best thinking and problem solving can occur, to lower, survival and emotionally\n      based brain centers. No matter the danger, it’s always most effective to remain calm. Here is where the regular\n      practice of a relaxation response comes in handy.Healthy engagement: from this calm perspective, identify what you can do to be as safe as possible. And then, take\n      these actions.After taking useful steps, stay alert and open to new information, but don’t waste time and energy going through\n      the millions of related links on the internet, or otherwise going over and over the same issues.When there are widespread dangers, there will be the tendency to go into the stress response frequently or\n      constantly. This is to be expected, as people around you as well as the media keeps bringing up the issue. But the\n      same lesson is true: this mobilization of your fight or flight response doesn’t give you any greater degree of\n      safety. Therefore – monitor your body’s response throughout the day, and continually remind yourself to go into a\n      calmer place, based on the steps above."

  "action_step": "Follow the process above: determine specific actions that you can take to prepare for danger, such as getting\n      extra supplies and designing your schedule to avoid large crowds. Tell yourself that you have taken the important\n      steps to stay safe. And then relax your body and shift your focus to important things in your personal life\n      needing attention.",
