    "title": "A focus on social bonding to enhance resilience. Take time to strengthen positive relationships and\n  experience emotional nourishment (Pillar #2)",
    "content": "Emotional nourishment occurs when we experience positive regard in our relationships. It is in these\n  experiences that our bodies release oxytocin, as well as neurotransmitters such as dopamine. These\n  biochemicals, in turn, help us feel calmer and enhance our ability to deal with stress. New research is also\n  suggesting that higher levels of oxytocin increase feelings of joy and security.It's easy to fall into patterns of isolation during the pandemic. Staying in contact, creating opportunities\n  for warm relationships requires greater intention. Yet, it's these very relationships that help you cope\n  with the challenges of today's world."
