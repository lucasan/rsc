    "content": "I would disagree with Ralph. Most of the time, this decision isn’t made consciously and thus it’s not made\n            by you. Most of the time, you continue along the path that was instilled in you by your developmental\n            environment and lessons. This is your Primitive Gestalt Pattern. Unless you wake up and take that\n            responsibility and make your own independent decision, you will continue to follow the easier, but less\n            rewarding path."

Embedded in this question is the instigation, the drive for an\n            answer. The question thus sets up an intention to find the answer in everything you do. Ask this question of\n            yourself today without having to give yourself an immediate answer. Instead, allow it to percolate inside.\n            Allow it to support the direction you take, and the decisions you make in your life.",
