But I’m not asking you to proclaim this to the world. Just to use this framework to\n      support your own success and growth. Also, this isn’t about being anything other than yourself, rather reaching\n      deeper inside to find your own heroic path. Appreciate yourself for your efforts and know that this puts you on\n      The Path.",

    "content": "Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to your awareness of yours and other’s emotions, appropriately managing and\n      regulating your emotions and harnessing these emotions for effective interpersonal communication. Today’s step\n      will address one aspect of your EI: non-verbal communication. You may notice reactions you have to certain people\n      – either positive or negative – without being able to put your finger on anything they said or did to produce this\n      feeling. In fact, you were reacting to either the prosody of their speech (stress and intonation patterns) or\n      their facial expression. If you are stressed or worried, it will create tension or a flatness in your speech. On the other hand, when you\n      are relaxed your speech takes on greater variation and calmness. Similarly, worry and fear are displayed in\n      unconscious facial expressions."

  "action_step": "Make an effort today to monitor your speech and facial expressions (you may even want to look at yourself in the\n      mirror) and then intentionally engage in some of your personal interactions coming from a relaxed demeanor.\n      Experiment with different voices based on imagining different emotional states. Notice the difference. When you\n      are with someone close to you, let them in on this experiment and get their feedback.",
  "journal_entry": "Make note of your non-verbal emotional intelligence (EI) of your speech and facial expressions and then relax and\n      notate the difference."
