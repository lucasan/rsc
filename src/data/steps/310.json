    "content": "When you carry a grudge, the only person affected by it is you. It creates tension in your body. It\n            activates your nervous system unnecessarily. And it takes control of aspects of your life because it makes\n            you reactive. Letting go of a grudge is not doing a favor for someone else, it releases you from bondage."

If the thought of this results in feelings coming up, let that be OK\n            and express the feelings. Then make the decision to let go.",
