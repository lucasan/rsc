    "content": "I was not able to choose between these two great quotes as guidance for today. So, let’s follow both of them. The\n      only way to fully experience life is to be present in as many moments as possible. Life happens in this moment,\n      not the past, the future – or in your head! Too much of the time you waste precious moments by regretting past\n      actions or events, holding a grudge, worrying about the future, or just existing – being on automatic and doing\n      what’s in front of you without thinking about it or your choices.We are in a time of great struggle, fear, and uncertainty. This can make it more difficult to be present – living\n      in the moment. But it turns out that, more than ever before, if you want to be resilient, living in the moment is\n      most important.And then there is Mr. Einstein who clearly is suggesting that the right choice is to live your life as though\n      everything is a miracle. This gives us guidance for today’s step."

  "action_step": "While you may have to do some planning today - taking care of business - try to live as much as possible in the\n      moment and, as Einstein suggests, as if everything is a miracle. Take time to look around and see that this is\n      true. Take a moment to listen and hear that this is true. Take time to taste life and feel life and know that this\n      is true.",
