    "content": "The development of a healthy relationship with yourself is the first pillar of resilience and is at the heart of\n        being successful in your life. I have discussed the goal of establishing a healthy internal voice or internal\n        parent that comes from a place of love, compassion, acceptance, support and care. Sometimes it’s difficult to\n        “feel into\\\" this place, because the old critical voice is so loud or powerful. As I say, “the old voice is\n        always incorrect, even when it presents a fact\\\", because it originates in an unhealthy place and tends to use\n        facts against you – not to support you!"

This is the realm of your healthy internal parent.\n        This is the one place where all negativity is shut out: no exceptions! Give this gift to yourself. This is a\n        place where you can see your specialness, your goodness. Take this time to find and be in this space.
