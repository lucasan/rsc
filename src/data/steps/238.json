    "content": "\"The secret of success is to do the common thing uncommonly well.\" John D. Rockefeller Jr.Many years ago, Herbert Benson popularized the notion of a “relaxation response\\\". This was essentially\n            about going into a parasympathetic or recovery mode that is experienced as a sense of relaxation. A typical\n            relaxation or visualization exercise helps a person engage in this response.Today I’m introducing the concept of a “Resilience Response\\\" which focuses on the fact that there is always\n            an optimal response – moment by moment – in your life that results in or maintains your greatest resilience.\n            This response occurs when you are able to be present and aware, without the baggage of negative or\n            judgmental thoughts, fear, or unconscious emotional unfinished business. This response balances the numerous\n            variables that go into being present and being in a place of harmony, while making the best choices to\n            maximize getting your needs met. This Resilience Response score begins with your assessment along my nine\n            pillars of resilience and success."
