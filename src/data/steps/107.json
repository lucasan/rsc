TheCoronavirus pandemic adds another layer to the concerns we face and another source of distraction. But we can'twait until this crisis is over in order to resume living our lives. It's important, and your responsibility tomake the most of every day of your life.I will take this a step further: to best be resilient during these difficult times, you need to approach today'scircumstance from a place of making the most of your current situation. This means, how can you find the\"benefits\" of isolation, of being in your home most, if not all of the time? Without the distractions and usingup your \"time\" with going to the movies, going out for dinner, events and just busy stuff - how will you make themost of this time? The most of your time today."

When we are thinking, in our heads, distracted,worrying or fearful, we retreat from the contact boundary and lose the gift of the moment. Try to be as much inthe moment, present, as possible today. Use doorways, portals, as a cue to bring yourself present. Notice whereyou are and that you are witnessing where you are and even who you are.",
