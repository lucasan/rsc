    "content": "If you noticed a difference yesterday by letting go of self-judgment and being more loving toward yourself, you\n      can imagine this can also make a difference in your relationship with others. In today’s environment we are\n      carrying an extra burden as we cope with this ongoing crisis with its uncertainty and danger. You want to be\n      looking for and identifying any source of stress that is within your control to eliminate or reduce. Conflict and\n      negative feelings can fall into this category."

Again, can you take a one-day holiday and shift into a more\n      accepting attitude? If you can, it gives you the opportunity to get closer to this person, offering greater mutual\n      support at a time when we all need it.",
