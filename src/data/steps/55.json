    "content": "Being on The Path means identifying your emotional unfinished business and working through and letting go ofthose feelings. When you do this, you will find that you have fewer and fewer \"buttons\" that can be pushed,causing you to emotionally react. However, this doesn't take care of the emotionally wounded people you encounter.And in today's environment everyone has become more emotionally reactive. Today let's address your management of the emotional energy surrounding you. I'm talking about the impact on youof the emotional turmoil of others, and how you respond. You want to be sensitive to the emotional pain of others,but not allow it to become toxic - or absorbed - by you. You want to be aware of the emotional pitfalls that arepresent, while not getting caught in them."

From this grounding, engage with others.Then, notice how you are reacting to the fears surrounding you. Notice if your stress response is being activated.Either during the conversation or after it's over, remind yourself that you can deal just as effectively with thesituation from a place of calm.
