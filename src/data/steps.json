It's about conscious living, appreciating every moment, and making beneficial choices. The Path encourages you to utilize your skills and experiences, live with purpose and balance, and strive to overcome hurdles. It also involves addressing your biases and their underlying causes. Being on The Path means taking ownership of your life and striving to progress despite any shortcomings. It's about accepting your current situation, even if it's not ideal, and moving forward without negativity. Today, I invite you to make a declaration: \"I want to be on The Path. I want to improve my Resilience Response. I want to learn healthy living tools that can slow aging. I am willing to dedicate 5 minutes a day to these goals.\" This focus will encourage new thinking, behaviors, and emotions, leading to a happier, healthier, and more satisfied life. If these goals resonate with you, then it's time to embark on The Path."

This may sound contradictory, but let's delve deeper. We often develop a habit of comparing ourselves to others, a practice likely rooted in our evolution. This comparison often leaves us feeling inadequate, leading to self-deprecating thoughts such as 'I should be better.' It's important to remember that you are on your unique journey, and it's impossible to be at two places at once. Thus, being hard on yourself for not being further along only undermines your self-worth. While self-criticism might seem to drive temporary improvement, it's ultimately harmful. The first step towards healthy growth is accepting where you are now, not necessarily liking it, but acknowledging it. This acceptance fosters a positive emotional response and reinforces the sentiment 'I deserve' from step 4 of The Path. Self-acceptance paves the way for progress and self-appreciation.

This worry results in physical tension, nervousness or anxiety, and the activation of your body's stressresponse. It also distracts from your present moment-the only place where real living and joy take place. As I findwith many of my clients, you may walk into your kitchen where family members want to be with you and talk withyou. Instead, your preoccupations interfere with this contact, leaving your family feeling neglected and possiblyrejected and depriving you of their love and validation. Thus, you are off The Path (again, defined as the optimalway of being in the moment). Another example is engaging in catastrophic thinking by imagining the worst possibleoutcome and focusing on it. This can lead to procrastination and avoidance. It not only creates fear but shiftsyour brain from the upper level or cortex where optimal thinking and problem solving occur, to lower survivalcenters, where we tend to revert to old learning patterns and lose creativity. Now, you might be saying, \"Wait a minute. I'm not a Pollyanna. Life can be dangerous, and I must always beprepared for what can happen, what can go wrong.\" This point is well-taken; life is full of uncertainty. We don'tknow exactly what to expect, and bad things can happen. It is important to anticipate and plan for futureproblems. Here the operative word is \"plan.\" However, once you have done the appropriate planning or thinkingthrough a situation, going over the plan again and again or thinking about what can go wrong, can be termed\"worry\" and obsessive thinking. I find that even when things are going well, our tendency is to worry about whatmight go wrong. Almost like an insurance policy. We sacrifice enjoying success or happiness in the moment in orderto \"be prepared\" for something negative that might happen in the future. Beyond planning, additional time andenergy devoted to worry is counterproductive and takes you off The Path."

These early childhood lessons - part of your Primitive Gestalt Pattern - shape the development of your brain aswell as your behavior. It is during this early stage of life that brain circuits, sometimes referred to as \"cellassemblies,\" are created and reinforced (i.e., become associated with success: getting your needs met or avoidingpunishment and pain). These cell assemblies gain strength, and those circuits and brain cells that are notreinforced disappear. In other words, your developing brain is a refleection of the world in which you grew up. Onceestablished early in life, these patterns become more and more difficult to shift. After all, they were learnedduring your earliest survival efforts and are literally imprinted in your brain. Furthermore, the development ofthese patterns began before you were able to verbalize the lessons; thus, they sit in your body as feelings-makingthem even more difficult to recognize. Primitive Gestalts \"lock in\" ways of thinking and behaving. In your early attempts at security and survival,they create answers to immediate needs. Fritz Perls, who helped found the Gestalt Therapeutic approach, noted thatas children we swallow messages (from parents and society) whole, without chewing or tasting. You make these\"rules of living\" your own, like the rules identified above. The conclusions you reach interfere with growth. As aresult, Primitive Gestalts and their neuroanatomical representations interfere with you getting your true needsmet and achieving true completion and happiness. We might also say that they limit your ability to adapt or learnnew lessons, a key to resilience. In fact, this existing internal voice or parent is never correct - even when itrecites some fact. This is because it is functioning from a framework of inaccurate motivations. It will thus usefacts to support that framework. And we are working to break free and establish a new and healthy framework."

You might even try out a GestaltDialogue in which you switch from one voice to the other - and have a dialogue. If you do this, I recommendactually switching chairs so that you are better able to distinguish when one or the other voice is talking.Remember the old voice is very powerful.

Second, when I got distracted oruncomfortable and wanted to stop, I realized that again, I was judging my performance in a negative way and feltunsuccessful. This made me less likely to continue. When I accepted \"being in the moment\" as the goal - not some other elusive outcome; and stopped judgment of howI was meditating or if I got distracted - suddenly I felt freed and lighter.

Inaddition, you are more likely to notice the negative, the potential dangers, rather than what's positive andcalming. In short, there is a greater focus on the negative which directly affects your mood and your self-judgments.

Right now, we can see a wide range of responsesfrom panic to keeping your head in the sand and hoping the danger goes away. So, here are the main points ofdealing with real dangers:Stay calm for best results: panic and worry actually leave you less capable of handling dangers, as they mobilizeyour body, using precious body resources, while not making you any safer. In addition, they also shift cognitivecontrol from your cortex where best thinking and problem solving can occur, to lower, survival and emotionallybased brain centers. No matter the danger, it's always most effective to remain calm. Here is where the regularpractice of a relaxation response comes in handy.Healthy engagement: from this calm perspective, identify what you can do to be as safe as possible. And then, takethese actions.After taking useful steps, stay alert and open to new information, but don't waste time and energy going throughthe millions of related links on the internet, or otherwise going over and over the same issues.When there are widespread dangers, there will be the tendency to go into the stress response frequently orconstantly. This is to be expected, as people around you as well as the media keeps bringing up the issue.

Your response presents two problems: 1) you tense and waste precious energy even when there isn't any realdanger (remember you don't have unlimited energy and your body is continually making choices between protectionand body healing), and 2) even when there is a real danger, preparing to fight the danger or run from it can bedraining as well as unproductive.

And this mightbe your normal tendency. This only leaves you feeling helpless and even more stressed. Furthermore, by avoiding,or mentally running away, you give yourself a negative message of being incapable of addressing the situation andultimately incapable of meeting your own needs. This causes a downward spiral in self-confidence. If, instead, youtake the challenge to face the difficulty, be proactive, and decide, \"I'm going to embrace this challenge\", youcultivate trust in yourself, resulting in growing your self-confidence and resilience.2. Challenge to learn from: the next part of this approach is to decide that this is an opportunity to learn andgrow. If you think about your life journey as one of self-discovery, what can you be learning from thisexperience?3. Challenge to go deeper inside: reaching inside to find your strength needs to be an ongoing process. Clientsask me, \"What am I looking for when I do this?\" \"How will I know if I'm doing it right?\" Think of a tall tree.The taller a tree wants to grow, the deeper and stronger must be its roots. The tree never asks; \"Am I reachinginto the earth correctly?\"4. Determining an intention for this difficult time that is pro-active and helps maintain calm in face ofdanger.5. Create an affirmation - a statement written as if you have already accomplished the intention. For example, \"Iam facing my fears, and this difficult situation. I am taking steps to help myself cope as well as to be calm inface of the danger.\" Write this on a 3x5 card and read it and meditate on it 5 times during the day todayincluding before you go to sleep.6.

Being present is what allows you to be fully engaged in life and besuccessful.In past steps I've referred to the \"contact boundary\". This is where your awareness meets the outside world. Oryour inside world, when you notice some feeling or sensation in your body, such as tension. Presence is when youare right there - at that contact boundary. When we have fearful experiences in our history, failures, or evenjudgements or criticism, it makes us uncomfortable being or approaching the contact boundary. Fear causes us toshrink from the contact boundary, shrink from being present.

These unconscious messages have evolved to let others knowabout the safety of you as well as the present situation. But you may be projecting messages you are not aware ofor prefer not to be sending. For example, if you are worried or stressed it can create tension in both your voiceand your face. This tension can give a signal of danger or uncertainty that unconsciously puts some apprehensionor disease into your encounters. Similarly, a parent who is preoccupied with some upset in their own life, canproject this in talking to their child.

Research has demonstrated that when we focus on something positive  or have a positive attitude, it actually causes a change in your brain: it makes you more sensitive to other  positive experiences. In other words, your brain wants to notice and tune in more to what's positive.  Conversely, when you focus on the negative, your brain again complies by becoming more sensitive to what's  negative in your environment. This demonstrates the tremendous power of your intention to change your brain and  to change your experience. Expressing kindness is one way for you to help your brain focus on the positive."

When this happens, it's your responsibility - in fact, your\n  ongoing life purpose - to notice and then figure how to restore that balance. You might notice being out of\n  balance physically when you have a headache or have difficulty falling asleep - indicating the dysregulation\n  of your nervous system. This can be addressed by practicing a relaxation exercise or doing biofeedback to\n  restore autonomic balance. On a more mundane level, noticing a grumbling in your stomach would indicate the\n  need to eat.You want to notice if you have \"emotional unfinished business\"; feelings that have not been dealt with or\n  resolved. This can be noticed if a small event triggers a large emotional reaction. It's then important to\n  identify what emotions you are holding in and haven't addressed - and then find a way to finish that\n  unfinished business. My book gives a step by step process to resolve unfinished emotional business. You\n  might also notice being out of balance in your cognitive approach to life or the perspective that you hold.\n  This might be recognized as you try to integrate the messages from the current \"Black Lives Matter\"\n  movement. This process might awaken you to some of your own prejudices that need addressing."

If we think of\n  anxiety as an internal messenger of danger, uncertainty can contribute to anxiety. Furthermore, the more you\n  tend to expect bad things to happen, the more anxiety will be triggered.There are three main ways we experience anxiety: physically, emotionally and mentally. A fluttering in the\n  stomach, a palpitation of your heart, sweaty palms are all manifestations of the anticipation of danger;\n  part of your \"fight or flight\" response. Whether there is real danger or simply an old trigger that reminds\n  you of danger, this physical signal can cause you to believe there is danger, and this will be experienced\n  as anxiety.If you think/imagine that something bad will or could happen; if you worry that you won't be able to meet\n  your needs, this too will be experienced as anxiety. The physical, mental and emotional responses will feed\n  on each other and result in a spiraling of anxiety.

Shifting into your healthy internal parent. From this healthy perspective (coming from a place of love,\n  compassion, acceptance, support and care) remind yourself that focusing on what can go wrong does not help\n  you. Judging yourself negatively also does not help you. Tell yourself that these messages are not only\n  undermining your ability to cope but are also inaccurate.4.

How do you let go of a real danger to be better able to focus on the present moment - and\n  thus function more effectively?First, it's important to acknowledge whatever is coming up for you; and whatever feelings you become aware\n  of. Simply trying to ignore or push down real concerns and the feelings they produce is the cause of anxiety\n  as well as depression. Real concerns require thoughtful approaches. Give yourself space, take a few breaths\n  and notice the feelings associated with these awarenesses. Perhaps there's anger, or a sense of loss, as\n  well as fear. Find some way of experiencing and expressing these feelings, such as voicing them or writing\n  about them.You want to follow this with a plan of actions to address the dangers. The plan may not be complete. Get as\n  far as you can with a plan. The plan should include everything you can do today - and perhaps for the week.\n  Then schedule yourself to take these actions.If the plan is just for today - decide that you have a plan and set of actions for today to address your\n  concerns (even if that is a plan to get additional information). There is nothing more you can do today.\n  Then let go - reminding yourself that you are doing everything you can and at least for today there is\n  nothing more you can do. Appreciate this.

Today I want to show you how your abdication of\n  this power; of your agency, or your choice, leads to big problems. Here is a typical example with its\n  inevitable consequences:You become anxious and fearful of some future event. You worry about what can go wrong. It might even keep\n  you up at night worrying and trying to control the outcome. Then the event happens, and your worst fears do\n  not occur. The result is usually much more positive - perhaps even the most positive outcome. Here are the\n  results of this experience:1. Despite your success, the memory of this experience is less about the success or relief. Instead what\n  gets remembered is the anxiety, the stress, the worry, and the upset that led up to the event. (After all,\n  much more time, energy and emotion went into the time prior to the event.) It becomes another negatively\n  stored memory - instead of the success that should be fully remembered.2. The relief or success of this experience is now paired with all the worry, stress and anxiety that lead\n  up to it. Thus, anxiety, worry and stress become paired with success: Neurons that fire together wire\n  together (D.O. Hebb)!!!3.

Without the events, the destinations, or vacations, it is easier to live on \"automatic\" in which\n  you go through the motions, or follow the pattern of yesterday - today, and tomorrow.

To be able to make any choice, you first must realize that there is one,\n  right in front of you. And that can only occur if you are awake in the moment. How can you \"try\" to be more present? How can you develop the ability to be more present? What does it\n  even mean to be present?Another way of thinking what being present means, is to be able to witness yourself in the moment.

The most basic of personal goals is to be efficient and effective with your energy - using it\n  purposefully - and then making sure you engage in a recovery process. Remember, everything you do and\n  everything your body does to stay healthy, requires energy. There are different ways of tuning in to your body and how efficient you are being with your energy.

You can use your hand as a sensor, placed on your\n  chest. If you do this consistently you will begin to notice differences in vibrational tone. With practice\n  this can inform you of your \"mind-body\" state. For example, you might check in and discover excess\n  vibration that indicates an over-activation of your body.

When that unfinished\n  emotional business is the need for acceptance or love, it will get channeled in non-productive directions.\n  For example, striving for more money, or working harder, which will never fill an emotional hole. And\n  finally, as unexpressed or unnoticed emotions build up (because they don't go away by themselves) they\n  provide a pool of energy that can get touched into by small events, triggering big reactions. Some feel stuck holding on to emotions because they are either uncomfortable with the feelings or fear the\n  consequences of their expression to someone who, well, just might get upset as well.

Athletes, for example can show a range that differs by as many as 30 or more beats per minute.But a particularly healthy pattern, referred to as heart rate \"coherence\", occurs when your heart rate\n  speeds up as you breath in, and slows down as you breath out; producing a smooth up and down curve. Positive\n  emotions such as gratitude facilitate this pattern, while negative emotions such as frustration create a\n  chaotic pattern."

The project collects\n  data from random number generators (RNG), (RNGs are machines that generate random numbers, separate from any\n  influence) from around the world.

The idea is that if there\n  is a powerful enough event that is simultaneously felt by many people around the world, this \"synchronized\"\n  experience might impact the output from the RNGs. If this occurred, it would be evidence of a global\n  consciousness and the impact of consciousness on matter. In other words, these generators could be used as sensing devices that detect the summated consciousness of\n  large populations if such a thing exists. Dean Radin, Chief Scientist at the Institute of Noetic Sciences\n  has published numerous findings that demonstrate this phenomenon actual happens. He coined the term\n  \"electrogaiagram\" because the idea is like an electroencephalogram, where you put electrodes around the\n  head - except here they were monitoring the \"head\" of Gaia, the planet itself. One such study looked at the output from these RNGs before and after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. These\n  studies have clearly demonstrated that this and similar events change the outputs of the RNG. In fact, they\n  determined that the odds against these results occurring by chance was about 3 trillion to one. Clearly\n  something real was happening."

Pick goals that are possible - even if you are unsure if you believe you can achieve\n  them - for now. If you are keeping a journal, create a separate place in it for this process. Write about\n  your goals as detailed as possible. 305:Create a description of your important goal.Make the description as detailed as possible.Visualize - imagine or picture in your head - the achievement of this goal in as much detail as\n  possible.As you do this, notice how it feels. This is getting the \"felt-sense\" of the achievement. 306: As you review one of the goals you are establishing for 2021, the one you have been visualizing, I\n  want you to think about how it CAN happen! I want you to focus on the possibility that it can happen. Again,\n  not that it's guaranteed to happen, but how it can happen. This means:You will be able to connect with and speak with people important in the achievement of this goal.You will be able to procure materials needed to achieve this goal.You will be able to schedule sufficient time to fulfil the tasks you will need to do.You will gather sufficient funds needed to move forward with reaching this goal.In other words, with each of the steps leading to your goal, you can see the possibility of each step\n  happening. Each of the steps, therefore, is possible.Complete your action step by saying, \"Each step along the way of achieving my goal is possible for me to\n  achieve!\" if I work hard enough, and stay focused enough, I will achieve my goal, which I have already\n  determined is possible."

      "content": "\"Right thinking\" points you in the direction of a successful life. A life of optimal health,\n  relationships, and performance. Right thinking supports living a life of excellence. You remember in school\n  when you took an exam or got your grades at the end of a year, the best students received grades of \"A\" or\n  Excellent. They were typically the students earmarked for great things in life. You can be that student. You\n  can live every day at the level of excellence. And source your results from this grounding.Excellence in your thinking refers to focusing on possibilities rather than difficulties, what can go right\n  rather than what can go wrong. Part of this process requires identifying unproductive or destructive habits\n  and working to eliminate them. One example is a tendency to get distracted easily when doing an important\n  task. If it's experienced as difficult, uncomfortable or with the concern of not being able to do it well,\n  there might be a tendency to shrink from it by shifting to something easy: an easier task, playing\n  solitaire, or simply checking out. Thus, right thinking is first recognizing the undermining negative\n  thinking, putting a fire wall between you and it, and then shifting into right thinking which would look\n  like, \"If I fully go for it I can do it - or I see the possibilities. I'm allowed to not be perfect and to\n  make a mistake. I will appreciate my efforts and be accepting of myself.\"Another example would be living with the expectation that something will go wrong, that the world is\n  dangerous, or someone will do you wrong. This \"wrong thinking\" will automatically cause you to shrink from\n  the contact boundary between you and your environment. When this happens, it renders you less present, less\n  available, and less \"response-able\". Right thinking focuses on what can go right, and how you can be\n  successful, and that people will respond positively to you.Sometimes before you know it, you have been triggered emotionally, you then make interpretations about what\n  is going on and potential dangers, based on this reactive emotion - based on past experience (derivative\n  from your childhood). Thus, you have gone into \"wrong thinking\". When this happens, it's important to\n  awaken out of your automated pattern and shift into right thinking mode, as noted above.Remember: your primitive gestalt pattern is never correct - even when it is presenting facts.
