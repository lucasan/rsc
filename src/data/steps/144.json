For any part of this process that you did, give yourself  credit. If you didn't complete the process, don't give up - keep working on it. Stay on The Path.",

    "title": "Recognizing the choice that is always in front of you (Pillars #1, 5, & 7)",
    "content": "As I've noted frequently, most of the time we are living in automatic mode. This means unconsciously following  old patterns, typically learned during childhood. It's not necessarily that these patterns are bad or negative -  although they frequently are - but they are certainly not something that you chose. When you are feeling upset  or discouraged, you can find an inappropriate message unconsciously given to you from that old pattern, that  triggers the upset.You will notice that I reference pillar # 7 as being strengthened or further developed with this daily step.  Pillar 7 is \"Presence\". In order to begin making decisions for yourself, you must first awaken to the moment -  become present - to notice that you are being controlled by the old messages. Then you are able to make a  choice: continue down this negative path or decide to focus on something more positive."

When you notice this, remind yourself that this doesn't serve you. And then switch to the positive  internal voice, or healthy internal parent, coming from a place of love, compassion, acceptance, and support.",
