It comes from your own actions.\\\" Dalai Lama XIVSometimes you are so busy with what must get done, stresses and distractions, that being happy slips to the\n            bottom of your “to do\\\" list – or doesn’t even make it onto the list. The Dalai Lama has said that the\n            purpose of life is to be happy. And while you can identify many other purposes to your life, I would suggest\n            that happiness, at least be included.I refer to happiness as living “above the line\\\". What line am I referring to? It’s the line that separates\n            enjoyment of life – above the line, from what must get done, and just trying to reach “ok\\\" or no disasters\n            – below the line. It’s the dividing line between thriving and surviving."
