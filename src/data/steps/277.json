    "content": "You are organized, biologically, to identify your needs and then engage with your environment to meet those\n  needs. This system breaks down when something gets in the way of noticing and identifying your needs. It\n  also breaks down if you take a passive or helpless position in meeting needs that you do recognize, perhaps\n  hoping that someone else will do it for you. Of course, it can also break down by going in the wrong\n  direction, the wrong path, that won't lead to success.This is the message and focus of the next few \"daily steps\". Needs can be physical, emotional, spiritual or\n  intellectual. Sometimes we translate emotional into material needs. When this happens outside of awareness,\n  these material rewards never satisfy or fill the emotional void."
