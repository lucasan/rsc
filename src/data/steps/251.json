    "content": "\"The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.\" Walt DisneyAre the tasks that you are doing the most important? Are they the ones that will take you beyond your\n            current limitations? Much of the time you gravitate to the actions that are familiar, and you are confident\n            in their accomplishment. Those that are either new or difficult, you say you are going to do, but strangely,\n            at the end of the day – they didn’t get done."

  "action_step": "Commit to following through with a task that you have been procrastinating on. Start by\n            visualizing/imagining doing it – in your mind. Try to visualize doing the entire task. As you do, notice the\n            resistance. Is it fear of judgment? Or simply the discomfort of doing something outside your comfort zone?\n            Do a few rehearsals in your mind. Make the experience as real as possible. If you do, when you actually do\n            it in real life, it will seem like you have already done it - which will make it easier. Remind yourself of\n            the messages of your healthy internal parent who tells you that you are ok and loved, and that it’s ok to\n            make a mistake. The voice would also tell you that you deserve to succeed. Go for it today.",
