Yet, how\n            many of these – or the items on your list – can be labeled as “most important\\\"? Do you waste time on less\n            significant actions while ignoring what will make the greatest difference in your life?I like to break down most important into three areas: personal, relationship and career or livelihood.\n            Personal is guided by your healthy internal parent and involves physical, emotional, mental and spiritual\n            health. Relationship is how you stay connected, support, love and care for family and friends and receive\n            their love and kindness. And career/livelihood is how you take care of and grow “business\\\" however you\n            define that."
