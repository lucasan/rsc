    "content": "Life is full of uncertainty. Today that seems truer than ever before. One way we get stuck in our efforts to\n            achieve our goals is wanting the certainty that what we do will work out; that we won’t be rejected,\n            disappointed, or make a mistake. If you think that the process of successfully achieving a goal takes, say,\n            ten steps, you might get stuck at the first step, even though the danger may be further down the road, at\n            the fifth step. Taking steps 1-4 that are not so dangerous however, might give greater support and certainty\n            when you get to step 5."
