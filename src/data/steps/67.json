    "content": "Life has become very constricted. We are limited in where we can go and what we can do. Our range of distractionshas been cut significantly. With shrinking outlets, and at the same time increased stress, the result is a growingsense of \"cabin fever\". This is a feeling of irritability, listlessness and upset resulting from confinement andlimitations. You want to be proactive in addressing this inevitable consequence and biproduct of the currentcrisis.Many of you are living in close proximity with family members. This combined with the emotional upsets of thiscrisis can create an environment fraught with opportunities for conflict and upset.

  "action_step": "Here are two steps to take, one for you as an individual and one for you and your family.Overcoming personal cabin fever: Remember, there is always a \"best way\" to deal with this or any situation. HereI'd like you to take your limitations and turn them into an opportunity. It's an opportunity to do a dailymeditation or relaxation/visualization practice. By practicing a relaxed breathing pattern or other type ofmeditation, you train yourself to be calm and content in the moment. When you do these focus on being accepting -of yourself and of others. Here is a link to one audio exercise and another can be found on my website:http://drstephensideroff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ImmuneStrengthening3.mp3Family: Daily activities, work, school and other tasks naturally separate us and give us \"space\" or time awayfrom those we live with. This normal process creates an automatic emotional and physical distancing and rhythm toyour life. As you are in closer proximity for longer periods it is helpful to establish ways of signaling theothers in your space that you need a time out. This is healthy. It's good to have an agreement that each personcan take this time and space without any questions being asked. This ability to set boundaries, in and of itselfcreates a sense of control and a necessary feeling of freedom that can be, well, freeing.",
