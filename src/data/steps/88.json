    "content": "In previous steps I’ve discussed the notion of your capacity. And I likened it to the size of a car engine. Bigger\n      engines have greater capacity. The advantage is that they can go up steeper hills or faster with less impact or\n      damage to the engine, less wear and tear. In other words, they are more resilient. How can you increase your\n      capacity to help you be more resilient?When you challenge yourself to do something that’s at your cutting edge – something that is a stretch – you expand\n      your capacity."
