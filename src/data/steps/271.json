The \"I\" reading this is embedded within the perspective and world view that you\n  absorbed. Whatever limitations you have about yourself come from this and are embodied in your internal\n  voice. But the way you think was not something that you determined for yourself. You didn't decide, \"Well,\n  this is the best way for me to treat myself or respond to the world.\" It's what you learned - directly or\n  indirectly.If you want to function most optimally and with resilience, it's important to notice these patterns and then\n  to make an independent decision as to whether they serve you and what might be a better approach."
