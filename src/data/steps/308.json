    "content": "If you are doing what today’s step says – staying focused - you will have noticed that I’m using the same\n            quote from Mr. Goethe, as yesterday. Courage focuses you on taking the next step – not looking for\n            guarantees and not dwelling on what can go wrong or what might not happen. I’m highlighting this quote to\n            indicate how important it is in you achieving success.Courage is making the decision to do whatever it takes to reach your goal. Courage is not allowing\n            nervousness, fear, or discomfort to stop you from taking the actions you must take. Furthermore, it’s this\n            display of courage – taking the challenge – that instigates the greatest growth in you. And it’s this growth\n            and self-trust, that then supports the achievement of your goals. Can you see the positive snowball effect?"
