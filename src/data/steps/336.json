But you have probably\n  noticed that while your successes bring a sense of relief - it's only temporary.As long as you tie your worth to your accomplishments - your results - you will only achieve fleeting\n  happiness. Deep satisfaction comes from liking who you are, accepting who you are, and deciding that this is\n  what gives you value."
