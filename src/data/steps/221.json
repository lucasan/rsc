    "title": "The easy path is the old path you are used to taking. The Path may require cutting down and pushing aside\n  the thicket that hides it. Find \"The\" Path. (Pillar 5)",
    "content": "Whatever comes easy, and is familiar to you, may not be your best path. It is the result of a) adaptation to\n  a less than optimal childhood environment, and b) unmet and unconscious needs and unfinished business. It is\n  important to choose your path based on a healthy approach. I've defined this as taking your direction from a\n  healthy internal parent coming from a place of love, compassion, acceptance, support and care. Following\n  these healthy messages may feel uncomfortable, difficult, or even wrong - but you must push through this\n  thicket to be on The Path."
