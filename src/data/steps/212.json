    "content": "Many of you are familiar with my talks over the years, on the mind-body connection. My research and programs\n  are based on how experience is intimately connected with physical symptoms as well as resilience and\n  personal success. We are learning in greater and greater detail exactly what the mechanisms are that\n  translate experience into our biology, into actual changes in brain and body.We now know that what we focus on - mentally - shapes the development of neurons and neuronal circuits. And\n  then, these circuits represent our thinking, attitude and other aspects of behavior."
