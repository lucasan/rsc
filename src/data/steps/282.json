This is your\n            primitive gestalt pattern. Part of this dependency gets transferred to your internal voice or internal\n            parent. While it can feel safe to play by the rules you were given, it is a major constraint that keeps you\n            dependent and ungrounded. It results in you worrying about what happens to you and what people say to you or\n            about you."
