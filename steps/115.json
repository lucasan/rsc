    "content": "“If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.\\\" –Napoleon HillEvery moment of every day you are given an opportunity to develop yourself and your abilities – to become more of\n      who you are. This is accentuated during this Coronavirus crisis. This step toward growth can be doing something\n      challenging, it can be a new awareness, it can be noticing self-sabotage and deciding not to buy into it. But the\n      foundation for growth, at the heart of whether you move forward in your life and toward your goals, is your\n      ability to be present; to be in the moment.One way of framing the intention to be present, is to decide that whatever you do, you will do it to the best of\n      your ability. This can only happen if you are fully present. Only when you are fully aware of the moment, will you\n      notice the self-sabotage; will you notice that your tendency is to repeat old and ineffective behaviors. Only by\n      being in the moment do you have choice; that leads to new behaviors and growth!"
