    "content": "Henry Ford once said, “If you think you can do it, or if you think you can’t do it, you are right\\\". In other\n        words, your beliefs will heavily influence your results. It was always thought that running a mile in under four\n        minutes was impossible. In fact, scientists actually provided proof that the human body could not achieve that\n        feat. Then in May of 1954 Roger Bannister ran the mile in three minutes and 59.4 seconds. But his record lasted\n        just 46 days until another runner surpassed him. In fact, in that first year after Bannister’s impossible was\n        achieved, six other runners broke the four-minute mile!Framing any goal or action that you want to take as either impossible or difficult sets up a mental barrier that\n        interferes with your progress."
