    "content": "There are good reasons to be kind to yourself and to others. Although some believe they must be hard on\n        themselves and always point out what they are doing wrong to get motivated or to be focused, this is never most\n        effective. Instead it contributes to impaired self-confidence, and insecurity that results in more negativity.\n        As I have pointed out, the best approach with yourself is from a place of love and acceptance. At the same time,\n        I suggest you be guided by the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\\\" Be kind to\n        yourself and be kind to others."

Experiment with this more positive approach and see if you like the\n        results. And at the same time, make it your intention today to take this same “step\\\" with others in your life.",
