    "content": "There are many reasons to always start your week with a plan. Of course, it's always better to know where\n  you are going. Like Yogi Berra once said, \"You've got to be very careful if you don't know where you are\n  going, because you might not get there.\" When you make a plan, your unconscious guiding system goes into\n  action. A plan helps you avoid making on-the-spot emotional decisions that are never the best. And it helps\n  you feel more in control of your life-an important ingredient of your resilience response. Perhaps most\n  important is that creating and following a plan makes it more likely that you will take the steps and\n  actions needed to ensure your success."

In today's step, I simply want to encourage you to start your\n  week or next seven days with a plan that includes three ingredients:\n  1. identifying and scheduling the most important actions that will best move you toward your goals,\n  2. spending a few minutes visualizing taking these actions and completing them, and, thus,\n  3. believing in yourself and that you can successfully engage in these action steps.",
