    "content": "Presence, my seventh pillar of resilience and success, is about an awareness of the moment. If you are going\n  to be \"response - able\" in life, you first must be in the moment to have choice. Whether we use the phrase,\n  \"monkey brain\", or habitual patterns, or, as Steve Jobs refers to \"dogma\", most of the time we are living\n  by the rules and conditioning of others.
