    "content": "An overriding goal of your body and your mind should be staying or returning to a place of physiological balance.It's from this place of balance that your mind and body function best. When we experience positive emotions, suchas appreciation and gratitude, the body's response is to turn on the parasympathetic - or recovery branch - ofyour nervous system. One type of biofeedback is referred to as heart rate variability (HRV) training. Stress andnegative emotions cause HRV to go into a chaotic pattern in which there is an overemphasis on the sympathetic oractivation branch of the nervous system. On the other hand, when we let go of stress and when we experiencepositive emotions, the HRV pattern becomes \"coherent\" looking like a smooth sinusoidal wave. When we are in HRVcoherence our heart rate speeds up with breathing in and slows down with breathing out. This results in asymmetrical sine wave. When this happens sympathetic and parasympathetic are in balance."
  },
  "action_step": "HRV coherence is facilitated by two things; a breathing rate of approximately six breaths per minute - or 10seconds for a full breathing cycle and experiencing positive emotions. Let's take just a few minutes to dothis:1. Put everything else to the side for 5 minutes. Get into a comfortable position and breath in, to the count of 4and breath out to the count of 6 (we emphasize breathing out, since that encourages more time in theparasympathetic [recovery] mode). As you breathe out, imagine melting or sinking into the chair, to allow all yourmuscles to let go.2. While doing this, focus on a person whom you have gratitude toward. Think of that person and your sense ofgratitude as you imagine breathing through your heart.After 5 minutes, notice how much calmer and more relaxed you feel.",
