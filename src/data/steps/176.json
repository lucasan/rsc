With so much going on in your life and the    need to make ends meet, little tasks add up until there isn't any time for the most important actions - those    actions that will truly make a difference in your life.To insure you are actively moving toward your goals it's important to set weekly and then daily actions for    yourself. To make sure that you are making progress in your life, live it with this intention."
