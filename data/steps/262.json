But\n            real power is when you choose and follow through with tasks that will make a difference in reaching your\n            goals. These challenges identified and taken will do more than move you closer to important goals. Following\n            through will also grow your self-confidence and trust in yourself. By my definition, this will increase your\n            power. And this will also result in greater resilience."
