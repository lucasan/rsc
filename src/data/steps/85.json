    "content": "Just as the foundation of a home gives it stability, grounding and security, your personal foundation serves the\n      same functions. A good foundation supports the rest of your life. With a solid foundation it’s more difficult for\n      you to be pushed off balance. You can best weather a storm and strong winds – or a virus. And you have a solidness\n      from which to better thrust out into the world.One way of strengthening your foundation is by determining where you want to plant your feet. What do you want to\n      stand on and for? Much of the time we allow circumstances and our environment, our parents to determine this for\n      us. In other words, it happens unconsciously, as we follow what we have been taught or shown, and we wind up in\n      positions we have difficulty supporting. Determining where you want to stand and being able to support this\n      position will begin to give your foundation strength."
