It's about conscious living, appreciating every moment, and making beneficial choices. The Path encourages you to utilize your skills and experiences, live with purpose and balance, and strive to overcome hurdles. It also involves addressing your biases and their underlying causes. Being on The Path means taking ownership of your life and striving to progress despite any shortcomings. It's about accepting your current situation, even if it's not ideal, and moving forward without negativity. Today, I invite you to make a declaration: \"I want to be on The Path. I want to improve my Resilience Response. I want to learn healthy living tools that can slow aging. I am willing to dedicate 5 minutes a day to these goals.\" This focus will encourage new thinking, behaviors, and emotions, leading to a happier, healthier, and more satisfied life. If these goals resonate with you, then it's time to embark on The Path."

This comparison often leaves us feeling inadequate, leading to self-deprecating thoughts such as 'I should be better.' It's important to remember that you are on your unique journey, and it's impossible to be at two places at once. Thus, being hard on yourself for not being further along only undermines your self-worth. While self-criticism might seem to drive temporary improvement, it's ultimately harmful. The first step towards healthy growth is accepting where you are now, not necessarily liking it, but acknowledging it.

In other words, your developing brain is a re\ufb02ection of the world in which you grew up. Once\n      established early in life, these patterns become more and more dif\ufb01cult to shift.

While this is specific to March of\n      2020, it serves as a good example of how to handle real dangers. Right now, we can see a wide range of responses\n      from panic to keeping your head in the sand and hoping the danger goes away. So, here are the main points of\n      dealing with real dangers:Stay calm for best results: panic and worry actually leave you less capable of handling dangers, as they mobilize\n      your body, using precious body resources, while not making you any safer. In addition, they also shift cognitive\n      control from your cortex where best thinking and problem solving can occur, to lower, survival and emotionally\n      based brain centers. No matter the danger, it\u2019s always most effective to remain calm. Here is where the regular\n      practice of a relaxation response comes in handy.Healthy engagement: from this calm perspective, identify what you can do to be as safe as possible. And then, take\n      these actions.After taking useful steps, stay alert and open to new information, but don\u2019t waste time and energy going through\n      the millions of related links on the internet, or otherwise going over and over the same issues.When there are widespread dangers, there will be the tendency to go into the stress response frequently or\n      constantly. This is to be expected, as people around you as well as the media keeps bringing up the issue. But the\n      same lesson is true: this mobilization of your fight or flight response doesn\u2019t give you any greater degree of\n      safety. Therefore \u2013 monitor your body\u2019s response throughout the day, and continually remind yourself to go into a\n      calmer place, based on the steps above."

And it doesn\u2019t matter if the threat is real or imagined, your body will prepare in the same\n      way. Your response presents two problems: 1) you tense and waste precious energy even when there isn\u2019t any real\n      danger (remember you don\u2019t have unlimited energy and your body is continually making choices between protection\n      and body healing), and 2) even when there is a real danger, preparing to fight the danger or run from it can be\n      draining as well as unproductive. The result is lowered resilience. (Think of this one study in which a high stressed group and a low stressed group were both given 10 mm cuts on\n      their arm. It took the high stressed group twice as long for the cut to heal.) Our society has developed far beyond the time when survival requires this outmoded response.

How you perceive, and how you think, make a very big difference in how well you go through this crisis. If\n      you can imagine yourself going through life as if you are on a \u201cLife Journey\\\" navigating through the best and\n      worst of times, then right now you can view the current situation as a challenge, one in which you will devote all\n      your intention and energy toward overcoming."

And this might\n      be your normal tendency. This only leaves you feeling helpless and even more stressed. Furthermore, by avoiding,\n      or mentally running away, you give yourself a negative message of being incapable of addressing the situation and\n      ultimately incapable of meeting your own needs. This causes a downward spiral in self-confidence. If, instead, you\n      take the challenge to face the difficulty, be proactive, and decide, \u201cI\u2019m going to embrace this challenge\\\", you\n      cultivate trust in yourself, resulting in growing your self-confidence and resilience.2. Challenge to learn from: the next part of this approach is to decide that this is an opportunity to learn and\n      grow. If you think about your life journey as one of self-discovery, what can you be learning from this\n      experience?3. Challenge to go deeper inside: reaching inside to find your strength needs to be an ongoing process. Clients\n      ask me, \u201cWhat am I looking for when I do this?\\\" \u201cHow will I know if I\u2019m doing it right?\\\" Think of a tall tree.\n      The taller a tree wants to grow, the deeper and stronger must be its roots. The tree never asks; \u201cAm I reaching\n      into the earth correctly?\\\"4. Determining an intention for this difficult time that is pro-active and helps maintain calm in face of\n      danger.5. Create an affirmation \u2013 a statement written as if you have already accomplished the intention. For example, \u201cI\n      am facing my fears, and this difficult situation. I am taking steps to help myself cope as well as to be calm in\n      face of the danger.\\\" Write this on a 3x5 card and read it and meditate on it 5 times during the day today\n      including before you go to sleep.6.

We are finding a way to complete what\u2019s incomplete. It\n      highlights an important universal truth: we are driven to complete anything that\u2019s incomplete. This can be a\n      project, a conflict or emotions that we experience, but ignore. It can also be fears and worries that might be\n      prevalent during the crisis we are all experiencing.Some of our unfinished business is beyond our control. In fact, in many ways, that\u2019s how life works. And right\n      now, with everyone\u2019s lives put on hold, there may be a growing accumulation of unfinished business. When something\n      in our lives is left unfinished, there is always a part of ourselves that\u2019s distracted, trying to reach\n      completion, such as unexpressed feelings or worries. What\u2019s most important is that you are aware of what needs to\n      be addressed, and find some way of either acting, or expressing your feelings, or consciously deciding to complete\n      what needs to be completed at a later time, if it isn\u2019t possible now. In other words, finding a way to reassure\n      yourself that something will be done, so you can temporarily let go and not continue to be distracted."

The\n            book is a first-person narrative of spiritual awakening as he goes through a transitional period in his\n            life.\n            We are currently undergoing a major disruption on a global level. Whether I refer to the ongoing fallout of\n            the pandemic, the climate crisis, political upheavals around the globe, or economic imbalance, there is\n            great uncertainty. It is at these times of change and even forced adaptation, that transitions or large\n            shifts in consciousness are possible. One concept that the protagonist discovers is how all living things\n            emanate unseen energy. This energy can be positive or negative. In addition, people can not only project\n            either positive or negative energy, but also intentionally pull in and absorb, and thereby drain the\n            positive energy of others."

One consequence of evolution is that\n            in its efficiency, the survival of a species (such as Homo Sapiens) results in the limitations on our\n            longevity. We have evolved like any other species to maximize the use of resources for the perpetuation of\n            our species. We are built to survive to produce off-springs, and then to help these dependent young live to\n            an age at which they can survive on their own. But there is no reason for precious resources to continue\n            being used up by us after this point in our lives.

How do you let go of a real danger to be better able to focus on the present moment \u2013 and\n            thus function more effectively?First, it\u2019s important to acknowledge whatever is coming up for you; and whatever feelings you become aware\n            of. Simply trying to ignore or push down real concerns and the feelings they produce is the cause of anxiety\n            as well as depression. Real concerns require thoughtful approaches. Give yourself space, take a few breaths\n            and notice the feelings associated with these awarenesses. Perhaps there\u2019s anger, or a sense of loss, as\n            well as fear. Find some way of experiencing and expressing these feelings, such as voicing them or writing\n            about them.You want to follow this with a plan of actions to address the dangers. The plan may not be complete. Get as\n            far as you can with a plan. The plan should include everything you can do today \u2013 and perhaps for the week.\n            Then schedule yourself to take these actions.If the plan is just for today \u2013 decide that you have a plan and set of actions for today to address your\n            concerns (even if that is a plan to get additional information). There is nothing more you can do today.\n            Then let go \u2013 reminding yourself that you are doing everything you can and at least for today there is\n            nothing more you can do. Appreciate this. Whenever you start to worry, remind yourself you are doing all you\n            can do and that any additional worry simply makes you less effective in following through with your plan.",

Today I want to show you how your abdication of\n            this power; of your agency, or your choice, leads to big problems. Here is a typical example with its\n            inevitable consequences:You become anxious and fearful of some future event. You worry about what can go wrong. It might even keep\n            you up at night worrying and trying to control the outcome. Then the event happens, and your worst fears do\n            not occur. The result is usually much more positive \u2013 perhaps even the most positive outcome. Here are the\n            results of this experience:1. Despite your success, the memory of this experience is less about the success or relief. Instead what\n            gets remembered is the anxiety, the stress, the worry, and the upset that led up to the event. (After all,\n            much more time, energy and emotion went into the time prior to the event.) It becomes another negatively\n            stored memory \u2013 instead of the success that should be fully remembered.2. The relief or success of this experience is now paired with all the worry, stress and anxiety that lead\n            up to it. Thus, anxiety, worry and stress become paired with success: Neurons that fire together wire\n            together (D.O. Hebb)!!!3.

This occurs, for example, when you\n            hold on to emotions such as anger and resentment or engage in unnecessary worrying. This leaves you less\n            resilient. The most basic of personal goals is to be efficient and effective with your energy \u2013 using it\n            purposefully \u2013 and then making sure you engage in a recovery process. Remember, everything you do and\n            everything your body does to stay healthy, requires energy. There are different ways of tuning in to your body and how efficient you are being with your energy. You\n            can take your pulse, or heartbeat, for example. The Chinese have 29 different locations for taking the pulse\n            and derive different meanings from each combination. You can use your hand as a sensor, placed on your\n            chest. If you do this consistently you will begin to notice differences in vibrational tone. With practice\n            this can inform you of your \u201cmind-body\\\" state. For example, you might check in and discover excess\n            vibration that indicates an over-activation of your body.

When this doesn\u2019t happen,\n            there is a pull toward resolution, be it conscious or unconscious. In other words, a part of us is\n            distracted by this need. But in addition, our efforts to not notice emotional unfinished business\n            contributes to anxiety, depression and scotomas, or blind spots in our awareness. When that unfinished\n            emotional business is the need for acceptance or love, it will get channeled in non-productive directions.\n            For example, striving for more money, or working harder, which will never fill an emotional hole. And\n            finally, as unexpressed or unnoticed emotions build up (because they don\u2019t go away by themselves) they\n            provide a pool of energy that can get touched into by small events, triggering big reactions. Some feel stuck holding on to emotions because they are either uncomfortable with the feelings or fear the\n            consequences of their expression to someone who, well, just might get upset as well. If you recognize that\n            what\u2019s unfinished is the expression of the emotion, not that the other person hears you or acknowledges your\n            feelings in any way, it opens an avenue for the expression and release of those emotions"

It\u2019s a way of studying mind-matter interactions.

Dean Radin, Chief Scientist at the Institute of Noetic Sciences\n            has published numerous findings that demonstrate this phenomenon actual happens.

One such study looked at the output from these RNGs before and after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. These\n            studies have clearly demonstrated that this and similar events change the outputs of the RNG. In fact, they\n            determined that the odds against these results occurring by chance was about 3 trillion to one. Clearly\n            something real was happening."

Each step this week supports that\n            process. Therefore, I wanted to include all the steps for this week in today\u2019s \u201cstep.\\\" Here are the \u201cSteps\\\" over this past week:300: Start off this week with a declaration of your beliefs in yourself. As you do this remember two things:\n            1) The declaration itself, engages a process in your brain that supports its reality and 2) the more you\n            declare, the more strength the belief develops. 301: Identify one of the negative messages you give yourself. Make the decision that treating yourself this\n            way is harmful and must stop. Then, shift into the voice of your healthy internal parent and speak from this\n            place of love, acceptance, compassion and support. Decide to make these messages your new way of treating\n            yourself. Create an affirmation to support this effort. 302: Let\u2019s begin the establishment of a plan, a mapping and finding The Path by visualizing some of the\n            things you want for this year. To begin with, it\u2019s not necessary to know the details of your plan or goals.\n            Today, simply dream and visualize. 303: Here are the 9 pillars of Resilience and Success:Relationship with selfRelationship with othersRelationship with something greaterPhysical balance and masteryMental balance and masteryEmotional balance and masteryPresenceFlexibilityPower \u2013 the ability to get things doneFor detailed descriptions of each of these pillars you can go to my website: www.DrStephenSideroff.comToday\u2019s step is to make a commitment for growth in each of these areas. For example:I\u2019m committing to be more loving and accepting of myself.I\u2019m committing to set better boundaries with the people in my life; or I\u2019m committing to be a better friend,\n            husband, wife, etc.I\u2019m committing to better define my purpose.I\u2019m committing to practice a regular relaxation exercise to better manage my tension and stress.I\u2019m committing to have a more positive attitude and to find what\u2019s positive in life.I\u2019m committing to not ignore my feelings and to resolve unfinished emotional business.I\u2019m committing to be more present in my life and less on automatic.I\u2019m committing to ways of being more flexible, such as seeing things from the perspective of others.I\u2019m committing to follow through with my commitments, so I develop greater trust in myself.This may not cover some of your most important career or financial goals. We will go through them tomorrow.\n            Today\u2019s commitments have to do with your foundation for success and better health. 304: Today let\u2019s make these dreams more concrete: Identify specific goals for 2021 that are most important\n            for you to achieve. Pick goals that are possible \u2013 even if you are unsure if you believe you can achieve\n            them \u2013 for now. If you are keeping a journal, create a separate place in it for this process. Write about\n            your goals as detailed as possible. 305:Create a description of your important goal.Make the description as detailed as possible.Visualize \u2013 imagine or picture in your head \u2013 the achievement of this goal in as much detail as\n            possible.As you do this, notice how it feels.

If the goals you\n            want are currently out of reach, as my 8th pillar of resilience suggests, be flexible and identify goals\n            that are more achievable."

They were typically the students earmarked for great things in life. You can be that student. You\n            can live every day at the level of excellence. And source your results from this grounding.Excellence in your thinking refers to focusing on possibilities rather than difficulties, what can go right\n            rather than what can go wrong. Part of this process requires identifying unproductive or destructive habits\n            and working to eliminate them. One example is a tendency to get distracted easily when doing an important\n            task. If it\u2019s experienced as difficult, uncomfortable or with the concern of not being able to do it well,\n            there might be a tendency to shrink from it by shifting to something easy: an easier task, playing\n            solitaire, or simply checking out. Thus, right thinking is first recognizing the undermining negative\n            thinking, putting a fire wall between you and it, and then shifting into right thinking which would look\n            like, \u201cIf I fully go for it I can do it \u2013 or I see the possibilities.

Right thinking focuses on what can go right, and how you can be\n            successful, and that people will respond positively to you.Sometimes before you know it, you have been triggered emotionally, you then make interpretations about what\n            is going on and potential dangers, based on this reactive emotion \u2013 based on past experience (derivative\n            from your childhood). Thus, you have gone into \u201cwrong thinking\\\". When this happens, it\u2019s important to\n            awaken out of your automated pattern and shift into right thinking mode, as noted above.Remember: your primitive gestalt pattern is never correct \u2013 even when it is presenting facts.
