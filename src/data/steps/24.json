    "content": "The more you can identify a purpose in your life, the less you will be bothered or stressed by everyday hassles.\n      A purpose gives you a larger horizon to your view of life. When you encounter a frustration or disappointment, you\n      can shift your focus (flexibility, Pillar #8) to the larger context of what you are trying to achieve – which is\n      your purpose. If you don’t have a purpose, it’s a helpful exercise to identify what’s important to you and turn\n      that into your purpose. While you might say your purpose is making more money, it’s always helpful to find a\n      purpose that has at least some aspect of contributing to the greater good. Doing this is a way to keep the energy\n      moving: sending it out as well as taking it in."

In either case, create a brief statement defining your purpose, and how you\n      put this into action. Turn this into your action step for today.",
