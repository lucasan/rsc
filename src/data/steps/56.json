    "content": "Your immune system that is your first line of defense against the Coronavirus is intimately linked to your\n      thoughts, stressors, hormonal system, nervous system and your emotions. There is now sufficient data to conclude\n      that immune modulation by psychosocial stressors and/or interventions can lead to actual health changes. This\n      means that you can have some control over how well it functions. Iâ€™ve discussed how stress can impair its\n      functioning. The more you are able to deeply relax the more you give your immune system the opportunity to\n      function at its best."
