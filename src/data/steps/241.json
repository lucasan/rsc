Mistakes are part of the process. In fact, it’s part of any learning\n            process. The rocket ship that took our astronauts to the moon was off course 98% of the time, but it was\n            continually receiving feedback and making adjustments that kept bringing it back on course. Similarly,\n            mistakes give you feedback to help you get it right, the next time. It’s important not to be shamed or\n            discouraged in this natural process"

It might be a business failure or mistake that cost you\n            a lot. Here are the steps for letting go:1. Experience and express whatever feelings are attached to this experience; sadness, loss, anger or\n            frustration.2. Find the lesson to be learned. If there was a loss from the mistake – a cost – you want to balance this\n            out with a benefit – a lesson.3. Hold the intention not to be defeated, but to rebound stronger.4. Forgive yourself and let go.",
