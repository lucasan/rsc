    "content": "There was a time when I found it very difficult to meditate. After a few minutes I’d become uncomfortable; I’d\n      get distracted; I’d feel like I wasn’t getting anywhere. I found this frustrating and a source of displeasure with\n      myself for not doing what I knew so many others were doing regularly. Then I made two decisions that changed my meditation practice and allowed me to be more successful at doing it\n      regularly and they both had to do with self-judgment. First, I recognized that I was continually looking for some\n      outcome that was elusive. And as a result of not finding it, became frustrated. Second, when I got distracted or\n      uncomfortable and wanted to stop, I realized that again, I was judging my performance in a negative way and felt\n      unsuccessful. This made me less likely to continue. When I accepted “being in the moment\\\" as the goal – not some other elusive outcome; and stopped judgment of how\n      I was meditating or if I got distracted – suddenly I felt freed and lighter. I began enjoying the meditation. And\n      most important, what I found was that I was more successful in staying in the moment. And this is the key to\n      success – any type of success: the ability to stay in the moment, and in contact with your environment. By being more accepting of myself and my performance, I was able to be in what I refer to as my optimal\n      emotional-physical-mental-spiritual state. As I said, in this state I feel lighter, less burdened, more present,\n      more appreciative and grateful."

  "action_step": "Today’s action step is living in “non-judgment\\\" to facilitate being in the present – in the moment. Much of what\n      you do will be experienced more positively if you remove all your judgments. In addition, if you can be with what\n      you are doing right in this moment rather than worrying about the future.",
