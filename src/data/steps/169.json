    "content": "In the process of biofeedback, in which you monitor some aspect of a person's physiology - such as muscle    tension - and feedback (thus, biofeedback) that information so the person learns to lower tension, the    information supports the learning process. The information is helpful whether the tension goes down or goes    up. In other words, when it goes in the wrong direction you are learning what you do that doesn't reduce    tension.In life and when you are doing something new or different, you also won't always get it right. But like the    biofeedback process, you want to frame your experiences as giving you important information helping you    continue to learn and discover the best approach - even when you make a mistake or get negative feedback from    your environment. When you do this, you make it easier to move forward, persevere and continue on your journey    toward success."
