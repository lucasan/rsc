    "content": "We all build a psychological wall between our awareness and our feelings. As children this is adaptive to help us\n      manage feelings that may be too difficult to experience. So, we find ways of “not noticing\\\". We carry these\n      defensive patterns into adulthood as part of our Primitive Gestalt Pattern described in my book and in previous\n      steps. Unfortunately, we are not able to be selective with what this wall blocks. And so, it also blocks us taking\n      in positive experiences and feelings. One consequence is that we have difficulty fully taking in our successes or positive actions and emotions. It is\n      when we can take in and integrate our positive experiences that we grow our foundation and our trust in ourselves."
