    "content": "\"Power\", the ninth pillar of Resilience and Success, is the ability to accomplish tasks. Your power increases with your belief in it, boosting your Resilience Response! However, power isn't innate but developed over time. Some grow up in nurturing environments that foster early power expression. Others may have their development hindered by negative experiences and self-judgments, part of your \"Primitive Gestalt Pattern\". Bad habits like procrastination may surface, but everyone has the potential for greater power with persistence and non-judgmental efforts. Start by identifying your goals and personal development areas. Perhaps there's an obstacle you've struggled to overcome or a discomforting task you've avoided. One major success determinant is taking responsibility to improve your life. Don't get stuck believing that you must accept your current state. Self-defeating messages can halt your progress. Remember, you aren't born with power but develop it. Any desirable quality is attainable with belief and effort. The pursuit of these qualities is what builds self-trust.
