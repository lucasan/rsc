    "content": "While the quote above refers to the criticism of others, the most toxic criticism is what we give to\n  ourselves. I've referred frequently to your Primitive Gestalt Pattern. This is the summation of all the\n  lessons learned as you adapted to your childhood environment. These lessons learned - consciously and\n  unconsciously, including when you were too young to even understand - guide your emotions, thinking and\n  behavior. The spokesperson for this pattern is the internal voice - or what I refer to as your internal\n  parent - that is with you 24/7. This voice, although we unconsciously believe and trust it, is not correct. The lessons it learned no\n  longer serve or support you. In fact, whenever you are feeling bad, anxious or uncomfortable, it is usually\n  because of a negative message from this place inside you. It has thrown you off-balance."

Then shift into the voice of a healthy internal parent coming from a place of\n  love, compassion, support, acceptance and care. Start to listen and trust this new internal voice.",
