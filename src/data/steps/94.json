    "content": "Just as your relationship with yourself is a foundational element to resilience and success, your ability tophysiologically self-regulate is also at your core - literally! It helps you feel \"at home\" in your body. Thismeans being able to deeply relax, notice when you are not calm, and being able to return to calm after you arestressed. When you are able to do these things, you can say you are in balance.Signs that you are out of balance include difficulty getting or staying asleep, frequent physical symptoms such asheadaches, digestive discomfort, cardiovascular issues, colds, and immune system problems. Most medications areused to help your body compensate for its inability to self-regulate, so the medications step in to try to do theregulating. Of course, this doesn't address the source of the problem."

  "action_step": "An earlier step on The Path was listening to a 15-minute relaxation/visualization exercise and the encouragementto do this every day. This \"practice\" is designed to compensate or balance out the frequent engagement of yourstress response. If you are continually \"training\" your body to activate its nervous system each time you arestressed, then there needs to be some time in which you train it in the opposite direction - to calm or turn downthe activation. There is no short cut. When you engage in this practice to restore nervous system balance, youhelp your body function better. This gives it the opportunity to heal and maintain optimal health.",
