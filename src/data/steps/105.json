    "content": "This is a theme I keep coming back to. Being satisfied with who you are instead of what others want you to be iscomforting and grounding. It reduces anxiety and self-doubt. However, as Mr. Emerson alludes to - being yourselfis very difficult to accomplish or even to know. The subtle process of being rewarded for meeting the expectationsof others right from birth, guides you in a different direction. You learn to satisfy the image others have foryou. Even if their intentions are good - it's usually not who you are, but who they feel you should be.Each step you take in owning and accepting who you are - separate from those teachings - helps you cope better andbe more resilient."
