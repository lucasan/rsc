    "title": "Finding ways to be accepting of reality. It will help you feel better about yourself and best support your\n  presence and growth (Pillars #7 & 9)",
    "content": "Remember, there is always a \"best way\" to be in this and every moment. And it starts with accepting \"what\n  is\". Acceptance doesn't necessarily mean you like \"what is\", but it's the acceptance of reality. Any other\n  approach to the present moment: \"why does it have to be this way?\", \"I wish this were different\", or \"I\n  should have done this differently/better\" - all result in greater upset, stress, and difficulty being\n  present and moving forward. It adds friction or resistance to your life's journey, with no benefit.So, as Mr. Wooden suggests, you will get the best results when you make the best of how things work out, or\n  how things are - in this and every moment.\"The more you accept each moment, the more you can be present each moment\" Stephen Sideroff"
