You really have to love yourself to get anything\n          done in this world.\\\" Lucille BallLucille Ball was not only funny, but she also had a good point here. Let’s focus on one aspect of this\n          message. To work toward, and be fully motivated for good things in life, and to avoid self-sabotage, it’s\n          important to feel like you deserve. When you love yourself, you want good things for yourself."

In my work consulting with peak performing athletes I found that the\n          tension generated in pushing yourself or telling yourself you should do better gets in the way of giving your\n          best performance. To benefit fully from being very motivated, you need to be accepting and let go. Today, make\n          a conscious effort to be more accepting of yourself as an expression of self-love.",
