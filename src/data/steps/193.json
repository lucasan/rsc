    "content": "Pillar number 3 of my model of resilience is your \"Relationship with something greater\". This includes\n  spirituality, meaning and purpose in your life. It also means an awareness and participation in your larger\n  community and your commitment to creating and maintaining resilient communities. A resilient community is\n  one in which people feel safe, are valued, and are treated fairly. In other words, this is the extension of\n  the qualities of a resilient individual.A resilient community works for everyone in the community. Many people operate out of a \"zero-sum\"\n  perspective. This means that if one person receives something positive, it's at the expense of someone else.\n  In fact, everyone benefits from everyone else's positive experience. And this is the basis of a Resilient\n  Community. Resilience results in the greatest good - for all the individuals as well as a community."

In fact, it might just be taking a class on racism or discussing this issue with others. Being willing\n  to share your perspective and learn from others. It also can mean being willing to acknowledge ways in which\n  you have been prejudiced or experienced bias from someone else.",
