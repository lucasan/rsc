    "content": "Struggling to say 'no'? Fearful of others' anger or rejection? This fear can make it hard to set boundaries, leaving you feeling vulnerable. Saying 'no' is a key way to protect ourselves and establish healthy boundaries. When we can do this, we're less affected by those with poor boundaries. Expressing anger can help set boundaries and connect with our power. If you find anger difficult, try expressing it alone. This helps you affirm that you're present and can't be taken advantage of. Successfully setting boundaries boosts your confidence and creates a sense of safety, promoting resilience."

  "action_step": "Identify where you need to set a boundary or express anger. Visualize people in your life and notice your feelings. If you find someone who you need to say 'no' to, decide if you can do it in person. If not, imagine saying 'no' loudly to them or expressing your anger. Observe if this exercise relieves you and helps you feel stronger, better at setting boundaries, and entitled to have your own boundaries. Consider it a 'dress-rehearsal' for real life.",
