    "content": "Research has demonstrated that a 30-minute impactful experience produces new growth to nerve cells in your\n  brain. When I first read that, I thought it was fantastic: how responsive our brains are to experience. But\n  of course, you can be impacted by either positive or negative experience and thinking. I have been\n  encouraging you to focus and make your impactful experiences positive ones.The best way of supporting positive impactful experiences and thus positive brain growth, is by calling on\n  your healthy internal parent or internal voice, as frequently as possible."

  "action_step": "I have been focusing this week on positive intentions and noticing daily \"choice points\" where you can\n  invoke your intention to take yourself in a positive direction. Today, when you notice a choice point, when\n  you are engaged in thinking about something in your life, call on your healthy internal parent to give you\n  advice and direction. This is the part of you we have been developing, coming from a place of love,\n  compassion, acceptance, support and self-care.",
