    "content": "“If you don’t love yourself, you cannot love others.\\\" – Dalai LamaThese days it can be easy to confuse self-love with narcissism or being self-indulgent. Remember that my eighth\n        pillar of resilience is flexibility. That means being able to be in – and appreciate - a mental or emotional\n        state, but not getting stuck there. In this case your relationship with yourself needs to be built upon a\n        foundation of love. It is your birthright and what you deserve. The only reasons for not feeling this way are\n        due to wrong messages received as a child. Loving yourself brings you into alignment with your goals (meaning\n        you feel like you deserve to achieve them). This makes them more likely to be reached."
