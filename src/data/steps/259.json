    "content": "Recently I did a step on Resilient Communities. A resilient community fosters connection and support and\n  safety. Resilient communities support healthy personal development and health. Conversely, when the ongoing\n  messages suggest danger, pitting one against another, lack empathy and don't support efforts to stem the\n  real threat of a virus, the resilience of a community takes a hit. Therefore, I see the shift confirmed by\n  this election to be a healthy change that will result in greater community resilience."

If you believe that the change occurring as a result of\n  this election will bring about a more focused solving of the Coronavirus pandemic and that this will improve\n  the economy and getting more people back to work; if you believe that a voice of reconciliation rather than\n  divisiveness and disregard will create a greater sense of security and calm, then take a step today - and\n  experience a greater sense of security and calm.",
