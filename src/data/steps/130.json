    "content": "A great man is always willing to be little.\" Ralph Waldo Emerson\"How would you interpret the above statement? Of course, there are many ways: being humble, without ego,  vulnerable, admitting to a mistake, giving someone else the spotlight. But perhaps most of all, if you are  willing to be little as well as big, you live with less anxiety and fear. After all, much of fear is of  judgments by others; judgments of being inadequate in some way."
