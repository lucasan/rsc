If you are having\n            any difficulty, it’s usually due to focusing on what can go wrong; how it won’t work out. If this is your\n            tendency, there will always be something that gets in your way. Those who are successful have the same\n            things that might go wrong; the same possible opportunities for rejection, or failure. They just don’t focus\n            in that direction. They look for and expect success."

And then focus on the positive results. Give yourself space to\n            notice the feelings associated with this success. And finally, commit to taking action today in line with\n            this.",
