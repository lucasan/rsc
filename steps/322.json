Fear of making a mistake? Fear of being\n            judged – by others or yourself? Fear of not knowing enough? Fear of not being enough? What’s most important\n            to move you forward in life is to take action – even in the face of these sources of resistance. What’s most\n            important is to find your courage to act even when there is uncertainty. What’s most important is to learn\n            that The Path for your progress in life and toward your goals and a growing trust in yourself is taking\n            these difficult steps and being on The Path."
